From there the MR technician (Bernadette Lovas, usually) will do another pre-scan overview to double check, will take them into the magnet room and get them set up, and then operate the scanner from the control room. You will be in the control room for assistance and also to carry out any study procedures. | 1-2 hour course | Ask Jeff or Bernadette when the next one is, happens when there is enough demand | . | MRI Training 2 is required to be the MR technician and access the scanning room without Bernadette. | Full-day course | Happens less frequently, ask Jeff or Bernadette | . | .

ERIS Information: https://rc.partners.org/it-services/computational-resources#erisone-linux-cluster . The ERIS Linux Cluster is an ecosystem of scientific computing resources centered around a cluster of remote-desktop and compute nodes connected to very high speed storage. A large selection of popular scientific applications are installed and you can request additional software packages to be added.  The cluster runs a Linux operating system and requires some familiarity with Linux for efficient use. This platform is ideal for workflows that run many jobs in parallel, and for those that read and write many files or require very high speed access to data files.  A job scheduling system queues jobs for dispatch to the compute nodes, allowing submission of many jobs at once.  Linux remote-desktop nodes allow graphical applications for data visualization to interacting with data stored on the cluster, as well as software development and application testing.  Some research groups also dispatch analysis pipeline jobs to the cluster through custom web-portals. Typical Uses . | Medical image processing | Genome sequencing | Monte-carlo modeling | MPI parallel workloads | Very large memory jobs | AI/ML and Deep Learning using NVIDIA GPUs | . Supported methods of connecting to the cluster . | SSH command line terminal for job submission | NoMachine Linux remote desktops for graphical applications | Network file share (SMB/CIFS) for data transfer | Web portals and applications (R Studio, Jupyter, etc) | .

    "content": "Sending Files to and from Amarel . Let’s assume you’re logged-in to a local workstation or laptop and not connected to Amarel. To send files from your local system to your Amarel /home directory, . scp file-1.txt file-2.txt &lt;NetID&gt;@amarel.rutgers.edu:/home/&lt;NetID&gt; . To pull a file from your Amarel /home directory to your laptop (note the “.” at the end of this command), . scp &lt;NetID&gt;@amarel.rutgers.edu:/home/&lt;NetID&gt;/file-1.txt . If you want to copy an entire directory and its contents using scp, you’ll need to “package” your directory into a single, compressed file before moving it: . tar -czf my-directory.tar.gz my-directory . After moving it, you can unpack that .tar.gz file to get your original directory and contents: . tar -xzf my-directory.tar.gz . A handy way to synchronize a local file or entire directory between your local workstation and the Amarel cluster is to use the rsync utility. First, let’s sync a local (recently updated) directory with the same directory stored on Amarel: . rsync -trlvpz work-dir gc563@amarel.rutgers.edu:/home/gc563/work-dir . In this example, the rsync options I’m using are: . | t (preserve modification times) | r (recursive, sync all subdirectories) | l (preserve symbolic links) | v (verbose, show all details) | p (preserve permissions) | z (compress transferred data) | . To sync a local directory with updated data from Amarel: . rsync -trlvpz gc563@amarel.rutgers.edu:/home/gc563/work-dir work-dir . Here, we’ve simply reversed the order of the local and remote locations. For added security, you can use SSH for the data transfer by adding the e option followed by the protocol name (SSH, in this case): . rsync -trlvpze ssh gc563@amarel.rutgers.edu:/home/gc563/work-dir work-dir . 🛠 [**Slurm Documentation**](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html) 📖 [**Amarel User Guide](https://sites.google.com/view/cluster-user-guide#h.17qhrejyd98m)** [**Amarel Intro and Basics - Video Tutorial](https://rutgers.mediaspace.kaltura.com/media/Weekly+Open+Workshop+-+December+17%2C+2020/1_62thyamw/171647611) (1hr)** Modules available in Amarel (2024) .

How to Change Your Mind: What the new science of psychedelics teaches us about consciousness . Michael Pollan always writes good books on everything from food to psylocibin. This one is quite interesting on a trendy topic. Neurogastronomy: How the bran creates flavor and why it matters  –  Gordon Shepherd . A very deep dive into the neuroscience of food. It gets pretty deep into the neuroscience, but remains fairly accessible. Very interesting and insightful. Gastrophysics: The New Science of Eating – Charles Spence . A bit more accessible, but a bit less neuroscience. Nevertheless its very engaging and will suck you in. Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay @neurograce . The Entangled Brain by Luis Pessoa @PessoaBrain . A Brief History of Intelligence by Max Bennett @maxsbennett . My favorite general book on neuroscience for high school students, neuroscience grad students, neuroscience faculty and everyone in between is “A Brief History of Intelligence” -Tony Zadorv . The Experience Machine by Andy Clark. Ed Yong, An Immense World . ‘Touching a Nerve: The Self as Brain’ by Patricia Churchland . History of Neuroscience in Autobiography: series from SfN . ",

So the voxels aren’t a network, the voxels get assigned to regions, and then network analysis is done on the 100-500 regions (which are groups of the voxels), with each of the regions being one ‘node’ in the brain network. Brain Network Analysis Pipeline . First level of analysis: Voxels from the fMRI scan directly . | ex: cortex surface = ~60,000 vertices . | do alignment, corrections, other preprocessing | . | 2 common preprocessing pipelines: . | Glasser 2013, aka Human Connectome Project Pipeline | fMRI Prep | . | lots of distortion corrections to be done to find the same voxel in two different brains, if you’re trying to cross-examine voxels | .

Third level: brain network . | take regions and connect them into networks - based on coactivation (activity measuring -&gt; Pearson’s correlation) for all of the regions against each other | divide those regions into groups to find 5-20 networks . | network = statistical dependency, pattern of coactivation . | nodes = physical regions defined by the positions of the voxels (or verticies, if you’re using surface data) on the brain which were indexed into that region | . | edge value between two nodes = statistical dependency of time series between two regions . | pearsons correlation of activation is a common method to calculate statistical dependency | . | . | people may say ‘partition’ for network | or may say ‘parcellation’ for network | or ‘atlas’” | .

    "content": "Date: February 5, 2024 2:15 PM . CCA is a method for determining the correlation between 2 sets of variables. Differs from regular correlation or pearson’s correlation, because you can have multiple vectors of values in each set. Pearson would correlation between 2 vectors of variables. This could be 3 vectors in one group and 5 vectors in the other, etc. Essentially, it creates a weighted formula to add all of the values for one row across the vectors in each group. This allows you to then do a correlation across 2 vectors, where the 2 vectors are amalgamations of values from entire sets of data . Method for “Unstandardized Coefficients” . | (as seen below) compute covariance matrix for x1, x2 by x1, x2 | (as seen below) compute covariance matrix for y1, y2 by y1, y2 | (as seen below) compute covariance matrix for x1,x2 by y1, y2 | (as seen below) transpose that matrix to get y1, y2 by x1, x2 | (as seen below) compute product of these 4 matrices | . | Compute eigenvectors and eigenvalues of this ^^ matrix Rx . | the first eigenvector holds the weights for x1 and x2 | the second eigenvector is irrelevant | . | the sqrt of the largest eigenvalue of this matrix Rx = the pearson correlation coefficient between the two sets of variables, 0.72 | (as seen below) Compute the product of a different order of matrices for matrix Ry | . | eigenvectors and eigenvalues of this ^^ matrix Ry . | the first eigenvector holds the weights for y1 and y2 | don’t use the second (or other) eigenvector— this would be seen as a ‘rest’ covariate and would give you incorrect correlation coefficients . | unless you have a LOT of vectors/variable sets in eahc group | then you could kinda take the 2nd eigenvector/value, 3rd, etc. until they’re small/residual, and look at it kind of like PCA | . | sqrt of eigenvalue of Ry is also 0.72 | . | compute the mean and standard deviation of the scores for each group (for X and Y, not x1x2y1y2) | standardize the scores by: . | subtracting the mean of that column from the first instance of that column (ie, X value in row 1 - mean(X)) | divide by standard deviation | do that for each of the cells | . | rescale the weights for the weighted equation . | divide the original weights for X cols (weight for x1x2, found by the above matrices calculation and the eigenvector) by the standard deviation of the X column | divide the original weights for Y col s(weight for y1y2, found by the above matrices calculation and the eigenvector) by the standard deviation of the Y column | . | Interpret the coefficients . | for example the coefficient for x1 aka SBP is 0.042, which means that if the SBP raises by 1 (say 120 to 121), the total score for X (aka weighted x1+x2) would increase by 0.042 standard deviations, given that the x2 variable (aka DBP) remains constant | . | . Method for “Standardized Coefficients” . | Standardize the scores before doing the correlation matrices | Do the above process step 1-10 | (as seen below) interpret the (different) coefficients . | If you increase the zx1 variable (aka SBP) by one standard deviation the standardized combined blood pressure will be increased by 0.477 standard deviations, given that the zx2 variable (aka DBP) is kept constant | . | . Loadings: . | (as seen below) Table of standardized correlation coefficients for each of the 4 variables (x1x2 y1y2) to the two sets/groups of variables (X and Y) . | Interpret the coefficients, aka Loadings: . | if we would calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the x1 values (aka SBP) and standardized X-set (weighted x1 + x2) values (aka zBP), the correlation coefficient is -0.57 | . | . | . | these values might be negative, even though they’d actually add to the group value positively . | this happens when the correlation of X and Y is positive | . | . “Cross-Loading” = in CCA, the pearson correlation coefficient between each variable and the Other grouped set, ie the group of variables it’s not a part of and is theoretically independent from (means the amount the one variable influences/correlates with the other whole set) . | this method is not the best for showing variable relationship | . | these values might be negative, even though they’d actually add to the group value positively . | this happens when the correlation of X and Y is positive | . | . ”Canonical Loadings” = in CCA, the pearson correlation coefficients between each variable and its’ corresponding grouped set, the sum set of variables that it adds to in a weighted form (dependent relationship) (means the amount to which it influences that group set) . | this method is not the best for showing variable relationship | . Interpretations . | if you want to make real-life conclusions about how x1 is related to X or Y, just go back to the basic correlation matrix | These loadings can be interpreted similar to PCA analysis | Can create this kind of figure (see below), to show how the variables and groups correlate with each other . | Mostly use the two groups correlation, 0.72 | . | .

Diffusion MRI (dMRI) and fcMRI have recently emerged as promising tools for mapping the connectivity of the human brain, each with distinct strengths and weaknesses. dMRI measures the diffusion of water, thus allowing direct noninvasive mapping of white matter pathways (Basser et al. 1994). However, dMRI is presently limited to resolving major fiber tracts. By contrast, fcMRI measures intrinsic functional correlations between brain regions (Biswal et al. 1995) and is sensitive to coupling between distributed as well as adjacent brain areas (e.g., see Sepulcre et al. 2010 for discussion). Although not a direct measure of anatomical connectivity, the functional couplings detected by fcMRI are sufficiently constrained by anatomy to provide insights into properties of circuit organization (for reviews, see Fox and Raichle 2007; Van Dijk et al. 2010). When describing these correlations, we use the term functional connectivity as coined by Karl Friston (1994) to denote “temporal correlations between remote neurophysiological events” for which the causal relation is undetermined. There are important limitations of fcMRI, including sensitivity to indirect anatomical connectivity and functional coupling that changes in response to recent experience and the current task being engaged (Buckner 2010). For these reasons, some discussions of fcMRI have emphasized that intrinsic activity measured by fcMRI reflects the prior history of activity through brain systems and not simply static anatomical connectivity (Power et al. 2010). fcMRI also does not presently provide information about whether connections are feedforward (ascending) or feedback (descending). These limitations constrain how analyses are conducted and results can be interpreted. | FreeSurfer . FreeSurfer is software that constitutes a suite of automated algorithms for reconstructing accurate surface mesh representations of the cortex from individual subjects’ T1 images (Fig. 1, B and C) and the overlay of fMRI on the surfaces for group analysis . | silhouette . the silhouette of a data point measures the similarity of the data point to other data points of the same cluster compared with data points belonging to the next closest cluster . | large-scale dynamical circuit model: . computational framework that aims to simulate and understand the complex interactions and dynamics of neural circuits on a large scale (ie many circuits and neurons) . | dynamic . time dynamics, patterns of activity over time . | dynamic connectivity . signal correlation between 2 regions over time . | stochastic . random . | neuronal dynamics . changes in electrical and chemical activity of neurons and network as a whole . | synchrony: . simultaneous action / occurrence . | spontaneous brain activity aka resting state analysis . analyzing which areas are firing simultaneously/connectedly while the body is at rest in the fMRI scanner . | local circuit properties . average properties of the neural circuitry in different regions of the brain. ie synaptic strength, firing rate, and other anatomical and functional properties . | index of . serve as a representative, proportional or indicative measure of another property . | principal resting-state functional connectivity (FC) gradient . the gradual change or variation in functional connectivity across the brain . strength observed between different brain regions . | parcellation . division of something into subsections . | temporal resolution . how accurate it is to real-time— for neuroimaging, measuring every millisecond = high temporal res (EEG is this), measuring every 2 seconds = low (fMRI is this) . | Pearson correlation .

Streamlines are constructed to pass through multiple adjacent voxels in DTI data, when the principal diffusion tensor per voxel aligns well with some of its direct neighbors (9). Tractography therefore produces subject-specific measures of regional interconnectivity that are ideally suited for brain network-level analysis. | Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) . | enables in vivo noninvasive study of white matter in the brain (6). This technique characterizes the diffusion of water molecules, which occurs preferentially in parallel to nerve fibers due to constraints imposed by axonal membranes and myelin sheaths (7). Metrics commonly derived from DTI, such as fractional anisotropy or mean diffusivity, reflect white matter microstructure and can index its integrity (7, 8). | . | MNI Space . defines the boundaries around the brain, expressed in millimeters, from a set origin . | White Matter .

    "content": "Science is hard, but it’s also fun. In the Holmes Lab, we want to make sure that everyone experiences a positive, engaging, hostility-free, challenging, and rewarding lab environment. To maintain that environment, we all have to do a few things. Expectation of Lab Members – Big Picture . | Support and respect your fellow lab-mates. Science is collaborative, not competitive. | Help others, and you can expect others to help you when you need it. | Scientists have to be careful. Don’t rush your work. Think about it. Implement it. Double and triple check it. Incorporate sanity checks. Ask others to look at your code or data if you need help or something looks off. It’s okay to make mistakes, but mistakes should not arise because of carelessness or rushed work. | If you do make a mistake, you should definitely tell your collaborators (if they have already seen the results, and especially if the paper is being written up, is already submitted, or already accepted). We admit our mistakes, and then we correct them and move on. | We all want to get papers published and do great things, but we do this honestly. It is never okay to plagiarize, tamper with data, make up data, omit data, or fudge results in any way. Science is about finding out the truth, and null results and unexpected results are still important. This can’t be emphasized enough: no academic misconduct! | Prepare to share your code. It is our goal to make all code, and if possible, all collected datasets, available to the broader scientific community. Make sure your code is well documented and, upon publication, we will strive to share it with the world (Lab GitHub). | If you’re struggling, tell someone. Your health and happiness come first. The lab looks out for the well-being of all its members. We are here to help. It’s okay to go through hard patches (we all do), but you shouldn’t feel shy about asking for help or just venting. Feel free to reach out to Avram at any time with questions or concerns. | If there is any tension or hostility in the lab that arises, something must be done about it. Lab members should feel comfortable in the lab. If you don’t feel comfortable expressing your concerns to other lab members, tell Avram. | Stay up to date on the latest research by using RSS feeds, following scientists on google scholar, and/or getting email updates from your favorite journals. Also consider following scientists on Bluesky. | Have a life outside of the lab, take care of your mental and physical health, and don’t ever feel bad for taking time off work. | . Expectation of Lab Members – Small Picture . There are a few day-to-day things to keep in mind to keep the lab running smoothly. | If you’re sick, stay home and take care of yourself. Because you need it, and also because others don’t need to get sick. If you’re sick, reschedule your meetings and participants for the day (or the next couple of days) as soon as you can. | You aren’t expected to come into the lab on weekends and holidays, and you aren’t expected to stay late at night. You are expected to get your work done (whatever time of day you like to do it). | Show up to your meetings, show up to run your participants, show up to your classes, and show up to lab meetings. | Be on time. Especially when you are running participants – in fact, our lab policy is to show up 15-20 minutes early to set everything up. And be on time for your meetings: respect that others have packed days and everyone’s time is valuable. | Make sure to also keep the study materials locked away and the key stored away in its proper space. | Keep the lab tidy. Eating in lab is fine, but clean up food waste, crumbs, spills. Put lab equipment back where you found it. Keep common areas uncluttered. | . Principal Investigator . I promise to abide by all of the above, and to also… . | Support you (scientifically, emotionally, financially) | Give you feedback on a timely basis, including feedback on project ideas, conference posters, talks, manuscripts, figures, grants | Be available in person and via e-mail on a regular basis, including regular meetings to discuss your research (and anything else you’d like to discuss) | Give my perspective on where the lab is going, where the field is going, and tips about surviving and thriving in academia | Support your career development by introducing you to other researchers in the field, promoting your work at talks, writing recommendation letters for you, and funding your conference travel as often as finances permit | Help you prepare for the next step of your career, whether it’s a post-doc, a faculty job, or a job outside of academia | Care for your emotional and physical well-being, and prioritize that above all else | . Post-Docs . All of the above, and you will also be expected to… . | Develop your own independent line of research | Help train and mentor students in the lab (both undergraduate and graduate) when they need it – either because they ask, or because I ask you to | Present your work at departmental events, at other labs (if invited), and at conferences | Apply for grants when appropriate (e.g., NRSA, K99). Though I will only hire you if I can support you for at least one year, it’s in your best interest to get experience writing grants and if you get them, you’ll be helping out the entire lab as well as yourself (because you’ll free up funds previously allocated to you) | Apply for jobs (academic or otherwise) when you’re ready, but no later than the beginning of your 4th year of post-doc. If you think you’d like to leave academia, that’s completely okay – but you should still treat your post-doc seriously, and talk to me about how to best train for a job outside academia | Challenge me when I’m wrong or when your opinion is different, and treat the rest of the lab to your scientific expertise and perspectives. | . What you can expect from Avram . I am typically on campus every Monday and Wednesday during the academic year from roughly 9:00 AM through 4:00 PM. I keep an informal schedule and have an open-door policy for my advisees. That means that I am usually available for informal discussions or to take a quick look at data when I am not teaching or attending meetings. I enjoy looking at preliminary results and helping to puzzle though analyses code, and these informal meetings keep me in touch with what is happening in the lab. Occasionally, I need focused time for writing and, if that is the case, I will let people know. I often disappear to the library for a few hours to avoid distractions when I need to write. I will meet individually with each graduate student and post-doc at least one hour per week during a regularly scheduled time that is mutually convenient. These meetings will involve a review of progress of the student’s ongoing project and/or a discussion of the scientific and methodological issues related to that project. I expect the advisee to come prepared to these meetings with their latest results and a list of issues to be discussed. I also will hold a scheduled full lab meeting for all individuals working in the lab (students, post-docs, visiting students, research staff), for at least 60 minutes per week. The agenda for these meetings will vary but will often include a more structured presentation by a lab member on a research topic. This may mean a presentation of that student’s research study, or the discussion by the group on a journal article or method. Additionally, we hold a weekly multi-lab meeting for at least 75 minutes per week. Currently, we are sharing this meeting with the Parkes Lab. This meeting provides the opportunity for students to present their work and solicit feedback from a larger audience. Students and post-docs are expected to present in this meeting at least once per year. As a rule, I don’t hold evening or weekend meetings. I can recall instances in the past where one-off weekend meetings were held prior to a conference presentation, grant deadline, international collaboration, or job talk, but this would be a rare occurrence. If you have limits on your ability to be in the lab due to a disability, a religious event, a medical emergency, or other reason, just let me know so an accommodation can be made. I keep a more relaxed summer schedule and do not come to the lab every day. Nevertheless, I do hold lab and individual meetings during the summer. In addition to weekly meetings, and occasionally dropping by the lab, you can usually find me working in my office. My door is almost always open; if it is, feel free to ask for a chat. I will always say yes, though sometimes I can only spare a couple of minutes or might ask you to let me finish typing a sentence. If my door is closed, assume that I am either gone, in a meeting, or I do not want to be disturbed – so please send a message (Slack or e-mail) rather than knocking. What I expect from you . I expect my primary graduate student advisees and post-docs to be in the lab for some part of every weekday. Working remotely can be very productive, but I believe that the intellectual environment of the lab benefits from the kind of informal interactions that occur when people are working side-by-side in one place. I expect my primary graduate student advisees to consult with me before engaging in projects with other advisers and other labs. I do not oppose such arrangements, which can be very beneficial to a student’s intellectual growth. I do worry, however, about time management and overcommitment. We differ to the degree to which we can manage multiple projects and remain productive. Therefore, it may be that different guidelines may be used for different students, and that these guidelines may change when we meet to review our individual advising compact. I similarly expect that my primary graduate student advisees consult with me before taking on additional work (such as teaching beyond the stipend) or volunteer activity (such as serving as a graduate representative to the IRB). In instances where my approval is required (such as approving a student to take on summer teaching), I have, on occasions, refused to provide that approval when I thought it would interfere significant with a student’s progress to degree. My concerns here are the same as above. I worry about time management and overcommitment. I expect that my primary graduate advisees follow the departmental and university guidelines with respect to vacation time. That is, students can take two weeks of vacation at a time when classes are not in session. Advisees may also take off when the University is officially closed (e.g., the week between Christmas and New Year’s). However, note that the University is not closed during undergraduate recess periods - such as fall and spring breaks. Hours . For graduate students, I understand having to be away for classes and TA-ing, but show up to the lab on a regular basis when you don’t have those obligations. To encourage lab interaction, try to be in most weekdays during ‘peak’ hours (assuming no other obligations) – e.g., between 11am and 4pm. This is not a hard rule, you can work at home occasionally, and I understand other obligations. But keep it in mind. At times I may work nights and during the weekends. This means that I will sometimes send emails or Slack messages outside of normal working hours. For the most part, I try not to, but sometimes I do. I do not expect you to respond until you are back at work (ignore me!). I do not expect there to be cases when I suddenly and urgently need something from you over the weekend (e.g., for a grant deadline), but should I anticipate that happening, I will bring it up in advance so we can plan accordingly. All this said, I realize that being told you can ignore my messages might not take away the stress of seeing my messages if you check your work email or Slack in the evenings or on weekends. If my off-hours messages are unwelcome and cause distress, please talk to me, and I will be better at not bothering you during your time off. Although I sometimes work weekends, I try to only do that when absolutely necessary. Please respect that by making sure to give me enough heads-up about impending deadlines so that I can get things done for you (e.g., write letters of recommendation, give feedback on manuscripts, etc) while maintaining my work/life balance.

    "content": "Choosing a research topic . Choosing good research topics is key to a successful graduate school career and beyond. There is no perfect formula for advising on research topics, which depends greatly upon the individual interests of the student. Presumably, a student has chosen to work in my lab because they have a general interest in our program of research. Consequently, in most instances, I have worked very closely with students on developing research topics that were very close to my core intellectual interests. However, I have also worked closely with students whose research interests diverged into areas with which I had less familiarity. In several instances, this has involved applying techniques in which I have expertise (e.g., neuroimaging) to topics in which I am not expert (e.g., genetic, molecular, or cellular bases of brain function; machine learning prediction of behavior; etc). This often necessitated expanding the student’s advising team to make sure that the student could be appropriately advised and, in at least one instance, this led to a co-mentoring arrangement. In other instances, a student’s diverging interests led that student to switch to a different adviser whose research expertise was more directly relevant. In general, research topics develop from conversations between my advisees and me about science that extend over many weeks and months. It is often the case that more direction from me is needed in a student’s initial years and less as the student’s research matures. Thus, re- search independence develops over time and at a different pace for different students. Funding issues in the lab play little or no role in the selection of research topics for graduate student advisees. This is not necessarily true for post-docs, whose research may be funded by grants to me on particular issues. Publishing research . Like other labs, we will follow the APA guidelines with respect to authorship: . “Authorship credit should reflect the individual’s contribution to the study. An author is con- sidered anyone involved with initial research design, data collection and analysis, manu- script drafting, and final approval. However, the following do not necessarily qualify for authorship: providing funding or resources, mentorship, or contributing research but not helping with the publication itself. The primary author assumes responsibility for the publication, making sure that the data are accurate, that all deserving authors have been credited, that all authors have given their approval to the final draft; and handles responses to inquiries after the manuscript is published.” . As a general rule, the roles that different individuals take with respect to published research is decided early in the process - ideally before the research project begins. In a typical paper from my lab, the student is the first author and writes the first draft of the paper. I am usually the last author. I work closely on the design of the study, in evaluating the results, and in editing the drafts for final publication. If others are involved in supporting roles, they are usually included as middle authors. If an individual plays a purely technical supporting role, they may be acknowledged in a footnote rather than be included as a co-author. It is also the case that I might enlist a student - usually an undergraduate - to carry out a study that I designed in full and which I write up. In this instance, I might be the first author on the paper. However, there have been exceptions to this policy. I have many times declined to be included as a co-author on work done in my lab for which I did not consider myself as having played a significant role. I do not approve of honorific authorships for myself or others. If I decline to be an author on a paper, it is almost always for that reason and it does not reflect on the quality of the work. One problematic issue that arises frequently is the orphaned study. This is a study for which a student collected the data, perhaps wrote a draft of the results, but left the lab before the paper was accepted for publication. If the student continues to work on the paper at a reasonable pace after they leave the lab, they remain as first author. However, if the student abandons a project performed in my lab and under my supervision, then I reserve the right to assign another student to complete the analysis and publish the paper. In that instance, the amount of work that the departed student completed before leaving will determine whether they are included on the final paper, and in what authorship position. For example, if a student collected data that was never analyzed or written up, and that student stopped working on the project (e.g., perhaps the student was now employed outside of academia), that student might be acknowledged in a footnote. It is common for research to be presented as a conference as a poster or platform talk before it is published. In those instances, the authorship list for the conference may be different and perhaps more expanded than the final authorship list on the published paper. Typically, the student who conducted the research presents the paper/poster at the conference at the expense of the lab. One last issue concerns the pace of research and publication. Science is a competitive enterprise with many labs often working on the same ideas, and publishing in a timely manner has important benefits. Yale is a high-level research university, and our graduate program is research-focused. Thus, my expectation is that conducting and publishing your research from the lab is your highest priority for your training. However, if a critical project (i.e., one central to the standing of the lab in the field or related to an important aim of the lab’s grant support) is languishing due to a perceived lack of effort, the leadership of that project may be changed.

    "title": "Communication Guidelines",
    "content": "Electronic communication . Science requires a lot of ‘head down’ time and the constant use of electronic communication (email, Slack, text) can drive us all to the point of distraction. I do expect that we will use email or Slack to communicate and organize meetings, but I will be always looking for ways to reduce the lab’s dependence on a constant buzz of messages. Journal publications . Submitting a paper for publication does not come with a prescribed deadline, but journal articles are more important to your career than departmental milestone documents. I generally work with students on papers in stages. With early drafts, I provide high-level organizational feedback. I frequently meet with students to ‘story-board’ the paper at the level of major points and major figures. In later drafts, I do word-level editing. In the early stages of a paper, where my feedback is organizational, I can usually provide it within one week. However, in later drafts, where I am word-level editing, a two-week period is more typical. Oral presentations . In addition to writing papers, learning to give an oral presentation about your work and to defend the work to an audience is essential to a successful career. I encourage students to present their work at as many campus venues as possible (e.g., Current Works, internal lab meetings, lab meet ings of other groups) because practice in giving talks is important. Students will also be presenting their work regularly at my weekly lab meeting. Learning to structure, pace, and deliver a talk is important, and I will strive to help you develop these skills. A common approach used in many labs at Yale, including my lab, is to review a student’s oral presentation with them immediately afterwards, to give pointers and constructive feedback. Depending upon the importance of the talk, it is also common to have one or more practice talks beforehand, where the presentation is shaped and critiqued. Learning how to answer questions from the audience is just as important as structure and pacing. For example, how a candidate handles questions is valuable information for a search committee to discuss following a job talk. You may find yourself presenting a talk to an advisory board for a granting institution, in which answering questions concisely and directly may be the difference between being funded or not. Throughout your academic career, you might find yourself presenting a talk to an audience in which individuals present are hostile to your research or skeptical of your results, and who express their opinions in the form of questions. Every faculty member has more than one story about giving a talk to a tough crowd. My point here is not that I encourage hostile questions at lab meetings. Quite the contrary. I do not tolerate rude comments during talks in my lab or ad hominem remarks disguised as tough questions. However, I do encourage the asking and answering of questions. Students learn to ask questions in a constructive way, and students need to learn to defend their work. We are all personally invested in our research, and we differ in our sensitivity to questions that challenge our results. If anyone in the lab feels that the feedback they are receiving is not constructive, then they should bring this immediately to my attention. Resolving Conflicts . If you have a conflict with another student, another faculty member, or a staff member that can’t be resolved with a conversation, you should bring this matter to my attention as soon as possible. It is my responsibility to you as your primary adviser to attempt to resolve disputes. If you have a conflict with me, you can talk to me directly. I have had such conversations in the past, so you needn’t worry about being the first. However, if you feel unable to talk to me directly, you can talk to a trusted faculty member, the DGS, or the Department Chair, who will then speak to me. You can ask them to maintain your anonymity if you so desire. If you have observed unethical behavior in the lab (e.g., anyone not following IRB procedures, or manipulating data, etc.), it is your duty to report this to me immediately and not attempt to resolve it on your own. The scientific and ethical integrity of the lab is my responsibility. I will not reveal your identity in investigating lapses in lab ethics. If you feel that you have been the target of harassment of any kind and in any context, you can bring this to my attention. I am familiar with the resources available on campus and I will strive to get you the support you need. You can also report the harassment to a Dean’s Designee, the Title IX office, the University-wide committee on sexual misconduct, or the Office of Institutional Equity and Access. If you choose to discuss matters with me, I can maintain confidentiality in most cases if you wish. However, like all faculty, I am bound by the law to be a mandatory reporter for Title IX complaints. ",

    "title": "Expectations for Ethical Behavior",
    "content": "Personal ethics . I expect that everyone in my lab will treat everyone else honestly and with respect. I expect this of myself also. Lab ethics . All lab members must read the IRB approved research protocols that govern the research con- ducted in the lab and abide by those protocols. If informed consent is required by the protocol governing your research, then it must be obtained and documented appropriately prior to running subjects. All students are responsible for documenting each step of their data acquisition and analysis procedures. The method of documentation (e.g., a traditional data notebook, an electronic notebook) should be discussed with me beforehand. Regardless of the documentation method, it needs to be accessible by me and must remain with the lab. All code and associated files used for analysis must also be documented and preserved in a manner approved by me (e.g., in the Holmes Lab GitHub repository). The documentation and associated code must be sufficient to allow me or a designee to replicate your analysis results and reproduce your figures. As PI of the lab, I am responsible for the accuracy of lab results. You also bear responsibility for your results. I am familiar with cases of suspected research fraud by graduate students. In those unfortunate cases, having step-by-step documentation is a strong defense. Whenever possible, students must test code they have written or statistical approaches that they are pioneering, with calibration or simulation data to make sure that the analysis is producing legitimate results. Additionally, students are expected to identify another lab member to check and review their code and analysis pipeline. It typically the case that this “code buddy” will receive authorship credit in any resulting manuscript. Students must keep dated drafts of major revisions to manuscripts, and that those drafts are preserved in a manner approved by me. Ethical lapses . Making a programming or analysis error is not an ethical lapse. However, realizing that you made an error and then hiding that fact is an ethical lapse. We should always be on the lookout for mistakes. If we find one, even in a paper that was already accepted for publication, we must admit the error and investigate its effect upon our results. If this means a paper is retracted or withdrawn, that is a better outcome than publishing a result that we know is incorrect. Repeatedly analyzing data using different preprocessing approaches or covariates with the goal of achieving a significant p value, a process known as p-hacking, is not permissible in the lab. It is also not permissible to stop the acquisition of data before the agreed-upon number of subjects were acquired because you achieved a significant result in an intermediate analysis. All procedures for analysis and all subject groups tested must be reported in the published work. Open Science . In recent years, there has been a strong support for more transparent lab procedures and reporting to remedy what has been called the replication crisis. Moving forward, I am interested in implementing more of the tenets of the open science movement in my laboratory such as preregistering studies, making all code public, and contributing data to open data repositories. Reproducible Research . If you gave someone else your raw data, they should be able to reproduce your results exactly. This is critical, because if they can’t reproduce your results, it suggests that one (or both) of you has made errors in the analysis, and the results can’t be trusted. Reproducible research is an essential part of science, and an expectation for all projects in the lab. For results to be reproducible, the analysis pipeline must be organized and well documented. To meet these goals, you should take extensive notes on each step of your analysis pipeline. This means writing down how you did things every step of the way (and the order that you did things), from any pre-processing of the data, to running models, to statistical tests. It’s also worth mentioning that you should take detailed notes on your experimental design as well. Additionally, your code should also be commented, and commented clearly. We all know what it’s like to sit down, quickly write a bunch of code to run an analysis without taking time to comment it, and then having no idea what we did a few months down the road. Comment your code so that every step is understandable by an outsider. Finally, it is highly encouraged that you use some form of version control (e.g., Git in combination with GitHub) to keep track of what code changes you made and when you made them, as well as sharing code with others. As noted above, the lab’s GitHub is https://github.com/HolmesLab. The lab’s GitHub should be used to share code, stimuli, and data with the world. Only share data after you’ve spoken to Avram (we don’t want to share the data too soon, before you’ve had a chance to look at it thoroughly yourself). When you share code, make sure it’s flawless, because we don’t want to distribute buggy code to the world! Have your “code buddy” and other lab members check it if possible. Ask Avram to get access to the lab’s GitHub. Reproducibility is related to replicability, which refers to whether your results can be obtained again with a different data set. That is, if someone ran your study again (with a different group of participants), do they get the same results? If someone ran a conceptually similar study, do they get the same results? Science grows and builds on replicable results – one-off findings don’t mean anything. Our goal is to produce research that is both reproducible and replicable. ",

    "content": "Example: Loadingfsl/6.0.0-gc563.lua . To use the command-line functions from the FSL (FMRIB Software Library) module that you’ve downloaded onto your system, you need to load the module first. Here’s how you can do it: . Step 1: Load the Module . Modules in many Unix-based systems are managed using Environment Modules or Lmod. These tools allow you to dynamically modify your shell environment to use different software packages. Given that you have the path to the module file (/projects/community/modulefiles/fsl/6.0.0-gc563.lua), you can load the module using the module command. module use /projects/community/modulefiles module load fsl/6.0.0-gc563 . Step 2: Verify the Module is Loaded . After loading the module, you can verify that the environment has been set up correctly by checking the paths or using module list to see if the module is active. This should show fsl/6.0.0-gc563 as one of the loaded modules. Step 3: Use FSL Commands . Once the module is loaded, you can use FSL commands like fslinfo, fsleyes, or any other FSL tools directly from the command line: . fslinfo &lt;your_image.nii&gt; fsleyes &lt;your_image.nii&gt; . Replace &lt;your_image.nii&gt; with the actual file you want to work with. Step 4: Unload the Module (Optional) . If you’re done with FSL and want to unload the module, you can do so with: . module unload fsl/6.0.0-gc563 . This will remove the FSL-related paths and variables from your environment. Notes: . | Environment Variables: When the FSL module is loaded, it will typically set environment variables like FSLDIR, PATH, and FSLOUTPUTTYPE, which are necessary for the tools to function correctly. | Modules: If module or ml commands are not available, your system might not use Environment Modules or Lmod. In that case, you might need to source the FSL environment script manually. | . Alternative: Source FSL Directly . If you prefer not to use modules, or if your environment doesn’t support it, you can source the FSL setup script directly: . source /path/to/fsl/etc/fslconf/fsl.sh . Replace /path/to/fsl/ with the actual FSL installation directory. This approach directly modifies your shell environment to include FSL tools. ",

Now, to train a model to predict the embedding layer… . STEPS: . 1. Define the Model and Loss Function: . Model Definition: . | Define a PyTorch model class (NodeEmbeddingModel in the example). | The model should include an embedding layer (emb) to learn node representations | . class NodeEmbeddingModel(nn.Module): def __init__(self, num_node=34, embedding_dim=16): super(NodeEmbeddingModel, self).__init__() self.emb = nn.Embedding(num_node, embedding_dim) def forward(self, x): return self.emb(x) . Here is a basic breakdown of a PyTorch model class: . | Inheriting from torch.nn.Module: . | A PyTorch model class should inherit from the torch.nn.Module base class. This base class provides functionality for managing model parameters, serialization, and other useful features. | . import torch.nn as nn class MyModel(nn.Module): def __init__(self, other_arguments): super(MyModel, self).__init__() # Define your model architecture here . | . | Initialization in the __init__ method: . | The __init__ method is used to define and initialize the layers and components of the neural network. | This is where you define the layers, embedding layers, recurrent layers, etc., that constitute your model. | input_size: The number of unique tokens or categories in your input data. For example, if you are dealing with word embeddings, the input size could be the size of your vocabulary. | hidden_size **The dimensionality of the embedding space. Each input token is represented as a vector in this space. | hidden_size for the linear layer = same as dimensionality of embeddings, because it takes the output of the embedding layer as input. | output_size for the linear layer might be 2 if you are performing binary sentiment classification (positive or negative), or it could be the number of classes for multi-class sentiment classification (e.g., 3 for positive, neutral, negative). | . | . | Forward Pass in the forward method: . | The forward method is where you specify how input data flows through the layers of your model. | This method is automatically called when you pass input data through an instance of your model. | . | . class MyModel(nn.Module): def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size): super(MyModel, self).__init__() self.embedding = nn.Embedding(input_size, hidden_size) self.linear = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size) def forward(self, x): embedded = self.embedding(x) output = self.linear(embedded) return output . Loss Function: . | Choose an appropriate loss function. In this case, nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss() is used, which combines sigmoid activation and binary cross-entropy loss. | . criterion = nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss() . Other loss functions: . | Mean Squared Error (MSE): . | Used for regression problems. | Measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values. | . criterion = nn.MSELoss() . | . | Binary Cross-Entropy Loss: . | Used for binary classification problems. | Measures the binary cross-entropy between the predicted probabilities and the true binary labels. | . criterion = nn.BCELoss() . | Categorical Cross-Entropy Loss: . | Used for multi-class classification problems. | Measures the cross-entropy between the predicted probabilities and the true class labels. | . | . criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss() . | Binary Cross-Entropy Loss with Logits: . | Similar to binary cross-entropy but more numerically stable when working with logits (raw model outputs) before applying the sigmoid activation. | . | . criterion = nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss() . | Custom Loss Functions: . | You can also define custom loss functions based on the specific requirements of your task. For example, you might want to create a custom loss function for tasks with specific constraints or objectives. | . | . def custom_loss(output, target): # Define your custom loss calculation return loss . During the training process, the loss is computed for each batch of data, and the model’s parameters are adjusted to minimize this loss through backpropagation and gradient descent. The choice of an appropriate loss function is critical and depends on the nature of the problem you are trying to solve. Optimizer: . | Choose an optimizer (e.g., Stochastic Gradient Descent - optim.SGD). | Pass the model parameters and set the learning rate. | . optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01) . 2. Data Preparation: . | Prepare your training data, including the training edges (train_edges) and corresponding labels (labels). | Ensure your data is in the appropriate format, and you may want to use PyTorch DataLoader for efficient batching. | . 3. Training Loop: . | Set the number of epochs and iterate over the data. | Forward pass the training data through the model. | Compute the dot product between node embeddings (dot_product). | Apply the sigmoid activation to obtain predictions (preds). | Compute the loss between predictions and ground truth labels. | Backpropagate the gradients and update the model parameters. | . num_epochs = 10 for epoch in range(num_epochs): embeddings = model(train_edges) dot_product = torch.matmul(embeddings, embeddings.t()) preds = torch.sigmoid(dot_product) loss = criterion(preds, labels.float()) optimizer.zero_grad() loss.backward() optimizer.step() . 4.

Important Python Basics . Initializing a Model: . By calling super(NodeEmbeddingModel, self).__init__(), you are essentially initializing the nn.Module part of your NodeEmbeddingModel. This is important because nn.Module provides functionality for managing the model’s parameters, serialization, and other features. Initializing the superclass is a standard practice when defining a new class that inherits from another class in Python. ",

Diffusion MRI (dMRI) and fcMRI have recently emerged as promising tools for mapping the connectivity of the human brain, each with distinct strengths and weaknesses. dMRI measures the diffusion of water, thus allowing direct noninvasive mapping of white matter pathways (Basser et al. 1994). However, dMRI is presently limited to resolving major fiber tracts. By contrast, fcMRI measures intrinsic functional correlations between brain regions (Biswal et al. 1995) and is sensitive to coupling between distributed as well as adjacent brain areas (e.g., see Sepulcre et al. 2010 for discussion). Although not a direct measure of anatomical connectivity, the functional couplings detected by fcMRI are sufficiently constrained by anatomy to provide insights into properties of circuit organization (for reviews, see Fox and Raichle 2007; Van Dijk et al. 2010). When describing these correlations, we use the term functional connectivity as coined by Karl Friston (1994) to denote “temporal correlations between remote neurophysiological events” for which the causal relation is undetermined. There are important limitations of fcMRI, including sensitivity to indirect anatomical connectivity and functional coupling that changes in response to recent experience and the current task being engaged (Buckner 2010). For these reasons, some discussions of fcMRI have emphasized that intrinsic activity measured by fcMRI reflects the prior history of activity through brain systems and not simply static anatomical connectivity (Power et al. 2010). fcMRI also does not presently provide information about whether connections are feedforward (ascending) or feedback (descending). These limitations constrain how analyses are conducted and results can be interpreted. | FreeSurfer . FreeSurfer is software that constitutes a suite of automated algorithms for reconstructing accurate surface mesh representations of the cortex from individual subjects’ T1 images (Fig. 1, B and C) and the overlay of fMRI on the surfaces for group analysis . | silhouette . the silhouette of a data point measures the similarity of the data point to other data points of the same cluster compared with data points belonging to the next closest cluster . | large-scale dynamical circuit model: . computational framework that aims to simulate and understand the complex interactions and dynamics of neural circuits on a large scale (ie many circuits and neurons) . | dynamic . time dynamics, patterns of activity over time . | dynamic connectivity . signal correlation between 2 regions over time . | stochastic . random . | neuronal dynamics . changes in electrical and chemical activity of neurons and network as a whole . | synchrony: . simultaneous action / occurrence . | spontaneous brain activity aka resting state analysis . analyzing which areas are firing simultaneously/connectedly while the body is at rest in the fMRI scanner . | local circuit properties . average properties of the neural circuitry in different regions of the brain. ie synaptic strength, firing rate, and other anatomical and functional properties . | index of . serve as a representative, proportional or indicative measure of another property . | principal resting-state functional connectivity (FC) gradient . the gradual change or variation in functional connectivity across the brain . strength observed between different brain regions . | parcellation . division of something into subsections . | temporal resolution . how accurate it is to real-time— for neuroimaging, measuring every millisecond = high temporal res (EEG is this), measuring every 2 seconds = low (fMRI is this) . | Pearson correlation .

Streamlines are constructed to pass through multiple adjacent voxels in DTI data, when the principal diffusion tensor per voxel aligns well with some of its direct neighbors (9). Tractography therefore produces subject-specific measures of regional interconnectivity that are ideally suited for brain network-level analysis. | Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) . | enables in vivo noninvasive study of white matter in the brain (6). This technique characterizes the diffusion of water molecules, which occurs preferentially in parallel to nerve fibers due to constraints imposed by axonal membranes and myelin sheaths (7). Metrics commonly derived from DTI, such as fractional anisotropy or mean diffusivity, reflect white matter microstructure and can index its integrity (7, 8). | . | MNI Space . defines the boundaries around the brain, expressed in millimeters, from a set origin . | White Matter .

These subjects are participating in research at the Clinical and Affective Neuroscience lab run by Dr. David Zald. Our lab is under the RWJMS Psychiatry umbrella. The parking access would be for Lot 58c on the Busch Campus. Despite Dr. Zald’s connection to BHI, we are looking to create a separate department and do NOT want to assign these parking permits to BHI. | Sentence in bold was added post-hoc as not including that caused parking to assume to permits were for BHI would make it so that everyone who has access to BHI would have access to our permits!! | . | . | Add Attachments: Add a PDF of the Purchase Order. | To get a PDF of the purchase order, follow the steps below: . | PDF Steps . | Go to the specific purchase order page. | If you don’t know how to find it, reference the steps here. | . | On the page, click the print icon found in the top right corner next to the text bubble with the question mark to create the pdf. | Image Reference . | . | Save PDF with the name given. - Image Reference | . | . | . | . | . | Assuming all goes well, DOTS will reach out in 1-2 days with a Nupark Account # which you will need to store in a safe space that you will remember! . | You will use the Nupark Account # when requesting new permits. | Nupark Account # is simply where the parking permits end up and do not indicate the funding mechanism of the permits! | . | . | . | “How did you know that CANL had to register as a new department for parking passes?” . | CANL (the name of Dr. Zald’s lab outside of CAHBIR proper) had not, as of then, needed to issue parking permits, so a departmental account was never created. Thus, we had to make one to issue parking passes that were being used for CANL-specific purposes. | Suppose you are using the CAHBIR parking permits. In that case, those permits must go to participants actively participating in a CAHBIR-specific project (i.e., using the scanner and potentially the ECG in the future, but don’t quote me on that). | So, if you expect your lab to have participants participating in your lab-specific projects and not CAHBIR-specific, then you would need to set up a departmental account since all parking permits are pooled and are not delineated by who purchased them per se. | For example, if you are in the CAHBIR departmental account, and you submit a purchase order for new parking permits for that departmental account using your lab’s start-up fund or grant money, ANYONE who has access to the CAHBIR departmental account could use it. | . | . | Since your lab is brand new, you still need to set up a departmental account. | . | “Do you know if the 1-visitor-day-pass for $1 is just for CAHBIR (like there can only be one visitor-day-pass from all of CAHBIR before you have to start paying full price), or is it for each lab/each requestor?” . | I am unfamiliar with the $1 pass for CAHBIR, so I cannot speak to that. | From my experience, all 1-day parking permits are $5 and have always been $5. | Feel free to contact Jeff Lucci, as he was initially the parking czar for CAHBIR (although it is way below his pay grade) if you have additional questions about the $1 parking permit. | . | . | “Could theoretically someone from my lab use it when commuting twice a week?” . | Unfortunately, parking passes CAN’T be used by Rutgers Staff OR Students, so lab members would not be allowed to use them even if they only come once or twice a week. The same goes for study participants if they are students! . | DOTS says that any violations of this could result in suspending the departmental account and shutting down the parking accounts for whoever was involved. | It’s a ridiculous rule, and I don’t know how they would know if your lab members never registered with DOTS, but I wouldn’t risk it. | There are visitor parking lots nearby that people can use (roughly a 5-minute walk). | e.g., Lot B near the Rutgers Day School . | Address of Rutgers Day School (671 Hoes Ln W, Piscataway, NJ 08854) | . | . | . | . | The student aspect is the most annoying, but DOTS is adamant about keeping it the same as there was rampant misuse of the system in the past, so we’re at an impasse. | . | . One pivotal thing that I just now updated in the Notion doc that I had previously left out. | To access the lab account you must have a car registered in DOTS and I believe also have a permit. | Our former lab manager rode his scooter (like those lime ones) to work and thus did not have a DOTS account, and they refused to let him hand out parking passes. It had to go through me for the longest time. | . | . ",

Common topics include dealing with expectations, bad mentorship, impostor complex, procrastination, luck, rejection, conflicts with advisors, and work- life balance, but these topics are always embedded in the speaker’s broader narrative. Since its inception, Growing up in Science has spread to many other institutions. It is now also a series of global online events, some of which have a special theme (e.g. anti-racism or mentorship).

How to take a Pearson’s correlated data set of brain regions, and investigate across-state network dynmics: . | Data Acquisition and Preprocessing: . | Obtain a dataset containing brain imaging data, typically functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or electroencephalography (EEG) data. | Preprocess the data to remove noise, artifacts, and ensure data quality. This may involve steps such as motion correction, spatial normalization, and temporal filtering. | See Preprocessing Pipeline doc | . | Defining Brain Regions of Interest (ROIs): . | Define a set of brain regions based on anatomical or functional parcellation schemes. These regions can be defined using atlases like AAL (Automated Anatomical Labeling) or the Harvard-Oxford atlas for structural MRI, or functional networks obtained from resting-state fMRI data using techniques like independent component analysis (ICA) or clustering algorithms. | Extract time series data from each ROI. | . | Calculating Pearson’s Correlation: . | Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the time series data of all pairs of ROIs. This yields a correlation matrix where each element represents the strength and direction of the linear relationship between the time series of two brain regions. | . | Dynamic Network Analysis: . | Utilize dynamic network analysis techniques to investigate changes in brain network properties across different states or conditions. This may involve methods such as sliding window correlation analysis, time-varying connectivity analysis, or dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) analysis. | Apply a sliding window approach to compute correlation matrices over consecutive time windows, allowing for the examination of temporal fluctuations in network connectivity. | Explore changes in network properties such as modularity, connectivity strength, or network flexibility across different states or experimental conditions. | . | State Identification: . | Define the states or conditions of interest based on experimental design or observed differences in brain activity. | Use statistical methods or clustering algorithms to identify distinct network states or transitions between states based on dynamic network properties. | . | Statistical Analysis: . | Conduct statistical analysis to assess the significance of differences in network dynamics between states. This may involve techniques such as permutation testing, analysis of variance (ANOVA), or non-parametric tests. | . | Interpretation and Visualization: . | Interpret the results in the context of the experimental hypotheses or research questions. | Visualize dynamic network properties and state transitions using techniques such as time-resolved network graphs, state space diagrams, or dynamic network metrics over time. | . | Validation and Reproducibility: . | Validate findings using appropriate validation techniques such as cross-validation, bootstrapping, or independent dataset validation. | Ensure reproducibility by documenting data preprocessing steps, analysis pipelines, and code/scripts used for analysis. | . | . By following these steps, researchers can investigate how brain network dynamics vary across different states or conditions using Pearson’s correlated data set of brain regions, providing insights into the functional organization of the brain.

Common Errors . foo = bar = error, because there are spaces between words foo“ “=” “bar . echo ‘Hello $foo’ → Hello $foo . because single quotes define strings and don’t read variables as variables . Assigning Variables . =, ie foo=bar . Defining Functions . ‘fn’ () { . defined function . } . **foo=bar** = sets foo to the value of bar . **echo “Hello $foo”** → Hello bar . source ‘fn’.sh = define the function fn, from the shell file, now its in your prog mem . | now ‘fn’ can be called directly | . $_ = replaces $_ with the last used argument . !! = replaces !! with the last line you ran . grep ‘x’ ‘file’= searches for ‘x’ in ‘file’ . x || y = or . 🌄 **$** in BASH In Bash, the dollar sign ($) has various meanings depending on its context. Here are some common uses: 1. **Variable substitution:** When followed by a variable name, the dollar sign is used to substitute the value of that variable. For example: - `my_variable=\"Hello\" echo $my_variable` This would print \"Hello\" because the value of the variable `my_variable` is substituted in the `echo` command. - **Command substitution:** The dollar sign, when followed by parentheses, is used to execute a command and substitute its output. For example: - `current_date=$(date) echo \"Current date is: $current_date\"` This would execute the `date` command, capture its output, and store it in the variable `current_date`, which is then used in the `echo` command. - **Special variables:** Some special variables in Bash also use the dollar sign. For instance, `$0` refers to the name of the script or shell, and `$1`, `$2`, etc., refer to the positional parameters passed to a script or function. - `echo \"Script name: $0\" echo \"First parameter: $1\"` If you run the script with parameters (`./myscript.sh param1`), it would print the script name and the first parameter. - **Arithmetic operations:** Inside double parentheses, the dollar sign can be used for arithmetic operations: 1. `result=$((5 + 3)) echo \"Result: $result\"` This would calculate the sum of 5 and 3 and store it in the variable `result`, which is then echoed. Remember that the context in which the dollar sign is used determines its meaning, so its function can vary based on the situation in your Bash script. ### . ",

Sample: N=270 at McLean and Rutgers (135 at each site), over 4 years . Demographics: Primary of Bipolar or SCZ, variety of severities, as well as comorbidities; Healthy controls . Aims . Objective: Establish connectome signatures, or “fingerprints”, that co-vary with cognition, negative valence systems, and social functions in healthy and clinical samples, dissecting their associated genetic and cellular bases. Questions to address: 1) To what extent can brain function predict symptom profiles (cognition, negative valence, and social functions) across transdiagnostic cohorts, revealing the presence of clinical subgroups . 2) Can a predictive modeling approach establish network profiles that precede longitudinal change . 3) Do cell type profiles recapitulate functional network organization in the general population . 4) Do these cellular associates of network function reveal genomic signatures that are co-heritable with psychiatric illness risk .

    "title": "Update to New Python in Amarel",
    "content": "Date: April 3, 2025 4:06 PM . Since we don’t have sudo privileges, this is how to update Python in your local user space on Amarel: . Installing Python from Source (without sudo privileges) . | Download the Python source code: Go to the official Python website and find the version you want to install. Alternatively, you can use wget or curl to download it directly. For example: . wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.6/Python-3.9.6.tgz . | Extract the tarball: Once the file is downloaded, extract it using the following command: . tar -xvzf /path/to/Python-3.9.6.tgz . | Navigate to the Python directory: Change to the directory of the extracted Python source code: . cd Python-3.9.6 . | Configure the installation: Configure the installation to install Python in your home directory (or any directory you have write access to): ./configure --prefix=$HOME/python3.9 . This will configure the build process to install Python in ~/python3.9 (you can change this to any path you prefer). | Build and install Python: Compile and install Python: . make make install . This will take some time, depending on your system. | Add the new Python version to your PATH: Once the installation is complete, add the bin directory of the installed Python version to your PATH. Open your .bashrc or .zshrc file and add the following line: . export PATH=$HOME/python3.9/bin:$PATH . Then, reload the shell configuration: . source ~/.bashrc # or source ~/.zshrc . | Verify the installation: Check the Python version to verify that the new version is being used: . python3 --version . If you installed Python 3.9, you should see something like: . Python 3.9.6 . | . Method 2: Using pyenv (Recommended) . pyenv is a popular tool for managing multiple Python versions without needing sudo privileges. | Install pyenv: If pyenv is not already installed, you can install it by running the following commands: . curl https://pyenv.run | bash . After the installation is complete, add the following to your .bashrc or .zshrc file to set up the pyenv environment: . export PATH=\"$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH\" eval \"$(pyenv init --path)\" eval \"$(pyenv init -)\" . Then, reload your shell: . source ~/.bashrc # or source ~/.zshrc . | Install a new Python version using pyenv: With pyenv, you can install any version of Python that is available. For example, to install Python 3.9.6: . pyenv install 3.9.6 . | Set the global Python version: After the installation, set the newly installed version as the global default: . pyenv global 3.9.6 . | Verify the new Python version: Check the active Python version: . python --version . This should return the Python version you installed using pyenv. | . Method 3: Using Miniconda or Anaconda (if available) . If you have the option to install Conda (Miniconda or Anaconda), you can manage multiple Python versions in isolated environments without requiring sudo privileges. | Download Miniconda (for example): You can download Miniconda from the official website or use the following command to install it in your home directory: . wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh . Follow the installation prompts, and make sure to allow the installer to initialize Conda. | Install a new Python version using Conda: Once Conda is installed, you can create a new environment with the desired Python version. For example, to create an environment with Python 3.9: . conda create --name myenv python=3.9 . | Activate the environment: Activate the new environment: . conda activate myenv . | Verify the Python version: Check the active Python version: . python --version . This should show Python 3.9 (or whichever version you specified). | . Using pyenv or installing Python from source are typically the most flexible methods, but if you need an isolated environment, Miniconda or Conda is a good option too. Let me know if you need help with any of these methods! . Step 2: Update python3 to Point to the Correct Version . It seems like pip3 is pointing to the correct version of Python, but python3 is still pointing to the old version (3.6.4). This can happen if multiple versions of Python are installed, and the shell is using the system’s default Python version instead of the one you installed manually. Here’s how to update your python3 version: . 1. Check Python Binaries . First, verify the location of the Python binary that your shell is using: . which python3 . This should return the path to your current python3 binary. It may still point to the older version (e.g., /usr/bin/python3). 2. Update python3 to Point to the Correct Version . You can set python3 to point to your newly installed Python (3.12.8 in this case). If the newly installed Python version is located in /home/kj537/python3.12.8/bin/python3, you can create a symbolic link: . ln -sf /home/kj537/python3.12.8/bin/python3 /usr/bin/python3 . However, this requires root (sudo) privileges to modify /usr/bin/. Since you don’t have sudo privileges, you can create the symlink in your home directory: . ln -sf /home/kj537/python3.12.8/bin/python3 /home/kj537/bin/python3 . Then, add /home/kj537/bin to your PATH in ~/.bashrc (or the appropriate shell config file): . echo 'export PATH=\"/home/kj537/bin:$PATH\"' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc . Afterward, source your .bashrc file: . source ~/.bashrc . Now, python3 should point to the correct version. Check it by running: . python3 --version . It should now show Python 3.12.8. 3. Update python3 Using update-alternatives (Optional) . If you have multiple versions of Python installed and are using a system with update-alternatives (common on Debian-based systems), you can set the default version using: . sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python3 python3 /home/kj537/python3.12.8/bin/python3 1 . But again, this requires sudo privileges, which you don’t have. 4. Verify the Setup . Finally, verify both Python and pip are updated: . python3 --version pip3 --version . Both should point to the new version (Python 3.12.8). ",

    "content": "` | **Heading level 2** | **Heading Best Practices** Markdown applications don’t agree on how to handle a missing space between the number signs (`#`) and the heading name. For compatibility, always put a space between the number signs and the heading name. | ✅  Do this | ❌  Don't do this | --- | --- | `# Here's a Heading` | `#Here's a Heading` | You should also put blank lines before and after a heading for compatibility. | ✅  Do this | ❌  Don't do this | --- | --- | `Try to put a blank line before... # Heading ...and after a heading.` | `Without blank lines, this might not look right. # Heading Don't do this!` | ## Paragraphs To create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text. | Markdown | HTML | Rendered Output | --- | --- | --- | `I really like using Markdown. I think I'll use it to format all of my documents from now on.` | `I really like using Markdown. I think I'll use it to format all of my documents from now on. ` | I really like using Markdown. I think I'll use it to format all of my documents from now on. | **Paragraph Best Practices** Unless the [paragraph is in a list](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#paragraphs), don’t indent paragraphs with spaces or tabs. **Note:** If you need to indent paragraphs in the output, see the section on how to [indent (tab)](https://www.markdownguide.org/hacks/#indent-tab). | ✅  Do this | ❌  Don't do this | --- | --- | `Don't put tabs or spaces in front of your paragraphs. Keep lines left-aligned like this.` | `This can result in unexpected formatting problems.   Don't add tabs or spaces in front of paragraphs.` | ## Line Breaks To create a line break or new line (``), end a line with two or more spaces, and then type return. | Markdown | HTML | Rendered Output | --- | --- | --- | `This is the first line.   And this is the second line.` | `This is the first line. And this is the second line. ` | This is the first line. And this is the second line. | **Line Break Best Practices** You can use two or more spaces (commonly referred to as “trailing whitespace”) for line breaks in nearly every Markdown application. Though, It’s hard to see trailing whitespace in an editor, and many people accidentally or intentionally put two spaces after every sentence. For this reason, some people may want to use something other than trailing whitespace for line breaks. If your Markdown application [supports HTML](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#html), you can use the `` HTML tag. For compatibility, use trailing white space or the `` HTML tag at the end of the line. There are two other options I don’t recommend using. CommonMark and a few other lightweight markup languages let you type a backslash (`\\`) at the end of the line, but not all Markdown applications support this, so it isn’t a great option from a compatibility perspective. And at least a couple lightweight markup languages don’t require anything at the end of the line — just type return and they’ll create a line break. | ✅  Do this | ❌  Don't do this | --- | --- | `First line with two spaces after.   And the next line. First line with the HTML tag after. And the next line.` | `First line with a backslash after.\\ And the next line. First line with nothing after. And the next line.` | You can add emphasis by making text bold or italic. ## Text Style **Bold** To bold text, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters. | Markdown | HTML | Rendered Output | --- | --- | --- | `I just love **bold text**.` | `I just love bold text.` | I just love **bold text**. | **Italic** To italicize text, add one asterisk or underscore before and after a word or phrase. To italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add one asterisk without spaces around the letters. | Markdown | HTML | Rendered Output | --- | --- | --- | `Italicized text is the *cat's meow*.` | `Italicized text is the cat's meow.` | Italicized text is the *cat’s meow*. | **Bold and Italic** To emphasize text with bold and italics at the same time, add three asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold and italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add three asterisks without spaces around the letters. | Markdown | HTML | Rendered Output | --- | --- | --- | `This text is ***really important***.` | `This text is really important.` | This text is ***really important***. | **Code** To denote a word or phrase as code, enclose it in backticks (```). | Markdown | HTML | Rendered Output | --- | --- | --- | `At the command prompt, type `nano`.` | `At the command prompt, type nano.` | At the command prompt, type `nano`. | **Escaping Backticks** If the word or phrase you want to denote as code includes one or more backticks, you can escape it by enclosing the word or phrase in double backticks (````). | Markdown | HTML | Rendered Output | --- | --- | --- | ```Use `code` in your Markdown file.``` | `Use `code` in your Markdown file.` | `Use `code` in your Markdown file.` | **Blockquotes** To create a blockquote, add a `>` in front of a paragraph. `> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.` The rendered output looks like this: > Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle. > **Blockquotes with Multiple Paragraphs** Blockquotes can contain multiple paragraphs. Add a `>` on the blank lines between the paragraphs. `> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle. > > The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.` The rendered output looks like this: > Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle. > > > The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood. > **Nested Blockquotes** Blockquotes can be nested. Add a `>>` in front of the paragraph you want to nest. `> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle. > >> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.` The rendered output looks like this: > Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle. > > > > The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood. > > **Blockquotes with Other Elements** Blockquotes can contain other Markdown formatted elements. Not all elements can be used — you’ll need to experiment to see which ones work. `> #### The quarterly results look great! > > - Revenue was off the chart. > - Profits were higher than ever. > > *Everything* is going according to **plan**.` The rendered output looks like this: > The quarterly results look great! > > - Revenue was off the chart. > - Profits were higher than ever. > > *Everything* is going according to **plan**. > **Blockquotes Best Practices** For compatibility, put blank lines before and after blockquotes. | ✅  Do this | ❌  Don't do this | --- | --- | `Try to put a blank line before... > This is a blockquote ...and after a blockquote.` | `Without blank lines, this might not look right. > This is a blockquote Don't do this!` | ## Links To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets (e.g., `[Holmes Lab Website]`) and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses (e.g., `(https://holmeslab.rutgers.edu)`). `Navigate to the [Holmes Lab Website](https://holmeslab.rutgers.edu).` The rendered output looks like this: Navigate to the [Holmes Lab Website](https://holmeslab.rutgers.edu) **Note:** To link to an element on the same page, see [linking to heading IDs](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#linking-to-heading-ids). To create a link that opens in a new tab or window, see the section on [link targets](https://www.markdownguide.org/hacks/#link-targets). **Adding Titles** You can optionally add a title for a link. This will appear as a tooltip when the user hovers over the link. To add a title, enclose it in quotation marks after the URL. `Here’s a link to the [Holmes Lab Website]([https://holmeslab.rutgers.edu/](https://holmeslab.rutgers.edu/) \"Lab Website\").` The rendered output looks like this: Here’s a link to the [Holmes Lab Website](https://holmeslab.rutgers.edu/). **URLs and Email Addresses** To quickly turn a URL or email address into a link, enclose it in angle brackets. ` ` The rendered output looks like this: [https://www.markdownguide.org](https://www.markdownguide.org/) [fake@example.com](mailto:fake@example.com) **Formatting Links** To [emphasize](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#emphasis) links, add asterisks before and after the brackets and parentheses. To denote links as [code](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#code), add backticks in the brackets. `I love supporting the **[EFF](https://eff.org)**. This is the *[Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org)*. See the section on [`code`](#code).` The rendered output looks like this: I love supporting the [**EFF**](https://eff.org/). This is the [*Markdown Guide*](https://www.markdownguide.org/). See the section on [`code`](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#code). **Reference-style Links** Reference-style links are a special kind of link that make URLs easier to display and read in Markdown. Reference-style links are constructed in two parts: the part you keep inline with your text and the part you store somewhere else in the file to keep the text easy to read. **Formatting the First Part of the Link** The first part of a reference-style link is formatted with two sets of brackets. The first set of brackets surrounds the text that should appear linked. The second set of brackets displays a label used to point to the link you’re storing elsewhere in your document. Although not required, you can include a space between the first and second set of brackets. The label in the second set of brackets is not case sensitive and can include letters, numbers, spaces, or punctuation. This means the following example formats are roughly equivalent for the first part of the link: - `[hobbit-hole][1]` - `[hobbit-hole] [1]` **Formatting the Second Part of the Link** The second part of a reference-style link is formatted with the following attributes: 1. The label, in brackets, followed immediately by a colon and at least one space (e.g., `[label]:`). 2. The URL for the link, which you can optionally enclose in angle brackets. 3. The optional title for the link, which you can enclose in double quotes, single quotes, or parentheses. This means the following example formats are all roughly equivalent for the second part of the link: - `[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle` - `[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle \"Hobbit lifestyles\"` - `[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle 'Hobbit lifestyles'` - `[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle (Hobbit lifestyles)` - `[1]: \"Hobbit lifestyles\"` - `[1]: 'Hobbit lifestyles'` - `[1]: (Hobbit lifestyles)` You can place this second part of the link anywhere in your Markdown document. Some people place them immediately after the paragraph in which they appear while other people place them at the end of the document (like endnotes or footnotes). **An Example Putting the Parts Together** Say you add a URL as a [standard URL link](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#links) to a paragraph and it looks like this in Markdown: `In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a [hobbit-hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle \"Hobbit lifestyles\"), and that means comfort.` Though it may point to interesting additional information, the URL as displayed really doesn’t add much to the existing raw text other than making it harder to read. To fix that, you could format the URL like this instead: `In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a [hobbit-hole][1], and that means comfort. [1]: \"Hobbit lifestyles\"` In both instances above, the rendered output would be identical: > In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort. > and the HTML for the link would be: `hobbit-hole` **Link Best Practices** Markdown applications don’t agree on how to handle spaces in the middle of a URL. For compatibility, try to URL encode any spaces with ` `. Alternatively, if your Markdown application [supports HTML](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#html), you could use the `a` HTML tag. | ✅  Do this | ❌  Don't do this | --- | --- | `[link](https://www.example.com/my great page) link` | `[link](https://www.example.com/my great page)` | Parentheses in the middle of a URL can also be problematic. For compatibility, try to URL encode the opening parenthesis (`(`) with `%28` and the closing parenthesis (`)`) with `%29`. Alternatively, if your Markdown application [supports HTML](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#html), you could use the `a` HTML tag. | ✅  Do this | ❌  Don't do this | --- | --- | `[a novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Milagro_Beanfield_War_%28novel%29) a novel` | `[a novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Milagro_Beanfield_War_(novel))` | ## Lists You can organize items into ordered and unordered lists. **Ordered Lists** To create an ordered list, add line items with numbers followed by periods. The numbers don’t have to be in numerical order, but the list should start with the number one. | Markdown | HTML | Rendered Output | --- | --- | --- | `1. First item 2. Second item 3. Third item 4. Fourth item` | ` .    | First item |    | Second item |    | Third item |    | Fourth item | . ` | 1. First item 2. Second item 3. Third item 4. Fourth item | `1. First item 1. Second item 1. Third item 1. Fourth item` | ` .    | First item |    | Second item |    | Third item |    | Fourth item | . ` | 1. First item 2. Second item 3. Third item 4. Fourth item | `1. First item 8. Second item 3. Third item 5. Fourth item` | ` .    | First item |    | Second item |    | Third item |    | Fourth item | . ` | 1. First item 2. Second item 3. Third item 4. Fourth item | `1. First item 2. Second item 3. Third item     1. Indented item     2. Indented item 4. Fourth item` | ` .    | First item |    | Second item |    | Third item      .        | Indented item |        | Indented item |      .    |    | Fourth item | . ` | 1. First item 2. Second item 3. Third item 1. Indented item 2. Indented item 4. Fourth item | **Bullet/Unordered Lists** To create an unordered list, add dashes (`-`), asterisks (`*`), or plus signs (`+`) in front of line items. Indent one or more items to create a nested list. | Markdown | HTML | Rendered Output | --- | --- | --- | `- First item - Second item - Third item - Fourth item` | ` .    | First item |    | Second item |    | Third item |    | Fourth item | . ` | • First item • Second item • Third item • Fourth item | `* First item * Second item * Third item * Fourth item` | ` .    | First item |    | Second item |    | Third item |    | Fourth item | . ` | • First item • Second item • Third item • Fourth item | Toggle Lists A toggle list takes a bit of HTML coding tags, but then enables the user to toggle the bullets to view and hide them. | ` Shopping list (click me!) * Apples * Oranges * Milk ` | --- | - Shopping list (click me!) - Apples - Oranges - Milk So it’s the same as a bullet list, except adding the `` and `` at the start and end, and adding `` to your title text ## Code Blocks Code blocks are surrounded by ```. This is how to format a code block: ```bash ```bash (or whatever language you want to code in) code code code ``` ``` This creates: ```bash code code code ``` ## Images `1. Open the file containing the Linux mascot. 2. Marvel at its beauty. ![Tux, the Linux mascot](/assets/images/tux.png) 3. Close the file.` The rendered output looks like this: 1. Open the file containing the Linux mascot. 2. Marvel at its beauty. ![](https://mdg.imgix.net/assets/images/tux.png) 3. Close the file. 1. Fourth item ## Divider Lines To create a horizontal rule, use three or more asterisks (`***`), dashes (`---`), or underscores (`___`) on a line by themselves. - `** --- _________________` The rendered output of all three looks identical: --- Divider line Best Practices For compatibility, put blank lines before and after horizontal rules. | ✅  Do this | ❌  Don't do this | --- | --- | `Try to put a blank line before... --- ...and after a horizontal rule.` | `Without blank lines, this would be a heading. --- Don't do this!` | ## Images To add an image, add an exclamation mark (`!`), followed by alt text in brackets, and the path or URL to the image asset in parentheses. You can optionally add a title in quotation marks after the path or URL. `![The San Juan Mountains are beautiful!](/assets/images/san-juan-mountains.jpg \"San Juan Mountains\")` The rendered output looks like this: ![](https://mdg.imgix.net/assets/images/san-juan-mountains.jpg) **Note:** To resize an image, see the section on [image size](https://www.markdownguide.org/hacks/#image-size). To add a caption, see the section on [image captions](https://www.markdownguide.org/hacks/#image-captions). **Linking Images** To add a link to an image, enclose the Markdown for the image in brackets, and then add the link in parentheses. `[![An old rock in the desert](/assets/images/shiprock.jpg \"Shiprock, New Mexico by Beau Rogers\")](https://www.flickr.com/photos/beaurogers/31833779864/in/photolist-Qv3rFw-34mt9F-a9Cmfy-5Ha3Zi-9msKdv-o3hgjr-hWpUte-4WMsJ1-KUQ8N-deshUb-vssBD-6CQci6-8AFCiD-zsJWT-nNfsgB-dPDwZJ-bn9JGn-5HtSXY-6CUhAL-a4UTXB-ugPum-KUPSo-fBLNm-6CUmpy-4WMsc9-8a7D3T-83KJev-6CQ2bK-nNusHJ-a78rQH-nw3NvT-7aq2qf-8wwBso-3nNceh-ugSKP-4mh4kh-bbeeqH-a7biME-q3PtTf-brFpgb-cg38zw-bXMZc-nJPELD-f58Lmo-bXMYG-bz8AAi-bxNtNT-bXMYi-bXMY6-bXMYv)` The rendered output looks like this: ![](https://mdg.imgix.net/assets/images/shiprock.jpg) ## Escaping Characters To display a literal character that would otherwise be used to format text in a Markdown document, add a backslash (`\\`) in front of the character. `\\* Without the backslash, this would be a bullet in an unordered list.` The rendered output looks like this: - Without the backslash, this would be a bullet in an unordered list. **Characters You Can Escape** You can use a backslash to escape the following characters. | Character | Name | --- | --- | \\ | backslash | ` | backtick (see also [escaping backticks in code](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#escaping-backticks)) | * | asterisk | _ | underscore | { } | curly braces | [ ] | brackets | | angle brackets | ( ) | parentheses | # | pound sign | + | plus sign | - | minus sign (hyphen) | . | dot | ! | exclamation mark | | pipe (see also [escaping pipe in tables](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#escaping-pipe-characters-in-tables)) | **HTML** Many Markdown applications allow you to use HTML tags in Markdown-formatted text. This is helpful if you prefer certain HTML tags to Markdown syntax. For example, some people find it easier to use HTML tags for images. Using HTML is also helpful when you need to change the attributes of an element, like specifying the [color of text](https://www.markdownguide.org/hacks/#color) or changing the width of an image. To use HTML, place the tags in the text of your Markdown-formatted file. `This **word** is bold. This word is italic.` The rendered output looks like this: This **word** is bold. This *word* is italic. **HTML Best Practices** For security reasons, not all Markdown applications support HTML in Markdown documents. When in doubt, check your Markdown application’s documentation. Some applications support only a subset of HTML tags. Use blank lines to separate block-level HTML elements like ``, ``, ``, and `` from the surrounding content. Try not to indent the tags with tabs or spaces — that can interfere with the formatting. You can’t use Markdown syntax inside block-level HTML tags. For example, `italic and **bold** . ` won’t work. ## Special Formatting ### Callouts These are specific callout formatting in our site. They are colored green for .new-title and red for .warning. You can create more callout types and customize their style by adding ```bash {: .new-title } > Green Callout > > text in here ``` {: .new-title } > Green Callout > > text in here ```bash {: .warning } > Red Callout > text in here ``` {: .warning } > Red Callout > text in here --- ### Table of Contents Insert this line of code into your page and it will generate a table of contents based on the headings which appear in that file, unless the heading has {: .no_toc .text-delta } beneath it. ```bash 1. TOC {:toc} ``` To make a nice table of contents, this format is recommended ```bash --- ### Table of Contents 1. TOC {:toc} --- ``` This creates: ![Screenshot 2025-04-15 at 8.00.58 PM.png](/docs/using-this-wiki/Using%20Markdown%201d6cf00eb936801ab4b3d070df2b21c6/Screenshot_2025-04-15_at_8.00.58_PM.png) --- ### Tables and Dividers You can make a table like this ```bash | name | head two | three |:-------------|:------------------|:------| ok | good swedish fish | nice | out of stock | good and plenty | nice | ok | good `oreos` | hmm | ``` | name | head two | three | --- | --- | --- | ok | good swedish fish | nice | out of stock | good and plenty | nice | ok | good `oreos` | hmm | You can create a divider like this ```bash * * * #or --- ``` --- --- ### Labels Labels like the following can be created with the example code below. For more colors/customizations, you’ll have to edit the [labels.scss](https://rutgers.box.com/s/rwsh4khiyl7rbmeqty5nfe9rqztp1pkf) file in the codebase. ![Screenshot 2025-04-15 at 7.55.22 PM.png](/docs/using-this-wiki/Using%20Markdown%201d6cf00eb936801ab4b3d070df2b21c6/5e602955-6772-40a1-94da-74e5f1da5bdc.png) ```markdown ### Labels Label type 1 {: .label } blue {: .label .label-blue } green {: .label .label-green } purple {: .label .label-purple } yellow {: .label .label-yellow } red {: .label .label-red } **bold** {: .label } *italic* {: .label } ***bold + italic*** {: .label } ``` ### Diagrams/Flow charts To create a chart like this, markdown/jekyll uses mermaid. Below is a simple code block, but if you want to know how to make more complex charts, look up Mermaid’s documentation. ![Screenshot 2025-04-15 at 7.56.47 PM.png](/docs/using-this-wiki/Using%20Markdown%201d6cf00eb936801ab4b3d070df2b21c6/Screenshot_2025-04-15_at_7.56.47_PM.png) ```bash ```mermaid graph TD; accTitle: the diamond pattern accDescr: a graph with four nodes: A points to B and C, while B and C both point to D A-->B; A-->C; B-->D; C-->D; ``` ``` ### Buttons To make a button like this: [View it on GitHub]([https://github.com/HolmesLab/holmeslab](https://github.com/HolmesLab/holmeslab)){: .btn .fs-5 .mb-4 .mb-md-0 } ```markdown [View it on GitHub](link){: .btn .fs-5 .mb-4 .mb-md-0 } ``` ## Color Schemes Just the Docs supports two color schemes: light (default), and dark. To enable a color scheme, set the `color_scheme` parameter in your site's `_config.yml` file: ```bash # Color scheme currently only supports \"dark\", \"light\"/nil (default), or a custom scheme that you define color_scheme: nil ``` Or, you can have a button on the page which switches between dark and light ```bash ```yaml # Color scheme supports \"light\" (default) and \"dark\" color_scheme: dark ``` Preview dark color scheme ``` ",

There are minor variations and discrepancies between Markdown processors — those are noted inline wherever possible. {: .warning } > Note about Line Breaks: > Markdown signifies linebreaks with 2 spaces (” “). So if your text on a file has a line break, but in the website view it doesn’t have a line break, try putting 2 spaces and then hitting enter for the line break. ## Headings To create a heading, add number signs (`#`) in front of a word or phrase. The number of number signs you use should correspond to the heading level. For example, to create a heading level three (``), use three number signs (e.g., `### My Header`). | Markdown | HTML | Rendered Output | --- | --- | --- | `# Heading level 1` | ` ",
