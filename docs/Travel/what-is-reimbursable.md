## **Procedures for Expense Reporting by Item**

### **Commercial Airfare**

Travel by chartered or private aircraft is prohibited without prior authorization from the Office of Risk Management and Insurance.

Travelers **must** purchase commercial standard coach class airline tickets through Concur or [Direct Travel.](https://procurementservices.rutgers.edu/travel_and_expense/booking_travel) Travel booked using other means will not be considered university business and will **not** be reimbursed.

Rutgers will reimburse a traveler for reasonable and appropriate baggage fees. Travel insurance is not reimbursable. Flights booked using personal airline Frequent Flyer miles are not reimbursable.

**Supporting Documentation:**

- Not necessary, airfare is booked and paid for via Concur

If out of policy exceptions are required due to unforeseen or unique circumstances, the [Travel Policy](https://powerforms.docusign.net/40926526-35f3-4aa2-a0b5-4b267801f3cc?env=na2&acct=3cff5fb1-3254-4a02-89b0-2495498a7f8f&accountId=3cff5fb1-3254-4a02-89b0-2495498a7f8f&recipientLang=en) [Exception Request Form](https://powerforms.docusign.net/40926526-35f3-4aa2-a0b5-4b267801f3cc?env=na2&acct=3cff5fb1-3254-4a02-89b0-2495498a7f8f&accountId=3cff5fb1-3254-4a02-89b0-2495498a7f8f&recipientLang=en) should be completed. This form must be approved **prior** to booking any air reservation. The approvals will be determined on a case-by-ase basis. The approved form must be attached to the traveler’s expense report.

Travelers should be mindful to keep costs low whenever possible. Tickets should be purchased at least 14-21 days in advance of travel. However, due to the cancelation penalties imposed by airlines, travelers should try to balance the need for savings generated by advance purchase with the knowledge that travel arrangements cannot be changed without significant penalty. Trip insurance is not a reimbursable expense.

When a more favorable price can be obtained for airfare by adding additional days to the trip, reasonable expenses for lodging and meals for the minimum necessary additional days may be reimbursed but the total cost of the reduced fare plus the additional days’ expenses must be lower than the lowest available airfare without the additional days of travel. Proof of the ticket fares must be included with the expense report to show the lower cost.

If a traveler chooses to drive rather than fly to the destination, mileage reimbursement and lodging cannot exceed the lowest cost of a commercial coach airfare. Travelers should include an airfare quote with supporting documentation. Meals or lodging will not be reimbursed while driving to the destination.

**Upgrades**

Travelers have the option to upgrade to business or first class by paying the difference with personal funds or by obtaining written approval from chancellor level prior to the trip. Upgrade from economy to premium economy requires written approval prior to the trip from the unit head. Proof of the standard coach class ticket cost and the upgraded ticket cost along with the written pre-approval must be included with the expense report to show the cost differences. Trips that extend beyond business purpose must provide a comparable cost estimate of the travel costs at the time of booking for the exact business days to ensure no additional cost is incurred.

### **Meal Expenses**

1. **Per Diem Meal Expenses**

Rutgers reimburses meals when travelers are in active travel status. Travel status is defined as traveling:

- For a period of at least 12 consecutive hours, or
- At least 100 miles from the Rutgers departure point.

When a traveler is not in travel status, meals are considered a personal expense and are not reimbursable.

Travelers have two meal reimbursement options. Travelers must select one option for the entire trip in order to receive reimbursement.

1. Rutgers per diem rate of $50 for all cities (domestic or foreign)
2. IRS per diem rates (see Related Links) for the city you’re visiting, as described on the University Procurement Services [Reporting Travel Expenses](https://procurementservices.rutgers.edu/travel-and-expense/reporting-travel-expenses)

The per diem must be reduced by the percentage below to prorate for provided meal(s) included with a hotel rate or at a meeting or conference:

| **Meal** | **% of meal per diem rate** |
| --- | --- |
| Breakfast | 20% |
| Lunch | 20% |
| Dinner | 60% |

The per diem rate must be prorated for the date of departure and date of return at 75% of the per diem rate minus any meals provided.

When the trip includes more than one location and the cities involved have different per diem rates, the rate for each day (beginning at 12:01 am) is the rate for the location where the traveler obtained lodging that night.

1. **Business Meals - Over Per Diem Rate**

Business meals are meals with a clearly substantiated business purpose and are directly associated with University business. Chancellors and Chief Business Officers can establish caps for business meals while budget owners can impose additional restrictions. An Internal Purchase Order (IPO) is the preferred way of payment for Dining Services while an IPO or PCard is the preferred way for Rutgers Club. Outside establishments can be paid by department PCard or Travel Credit Card.

Business meals should adhere to the following rules:

- Acceptable reasons for business meals include meals with a guest speaker, lecturer or prospective faculty, staff or students. These meals should be limited in terms of number of attendees and the total cost should be reasonable and prudent. If alcohol is included in the meal, the restricted fund source must allow for reimbursement.
- Business meals while not in travel status with other Rutgers colleagues in local restaurants are generally not reimbursable. Local meals with colleagues should be considered a personal expense.
- Business meal expenses include food, beverages, catering services and banquet facilities. Payments to a caterer, facility or transportation of food should be processed using a university purchase order whenever possible.
1. **Group and other Business meals (not subject to per diem allowance)**
- Expenses must be reasonable and prudent
- Special Occasions – retirements, celebrations etc. Prior approval is required in writing from the Dean/Chancellor’s Office
