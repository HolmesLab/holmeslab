## 6 Adding flights

- If you've done a 'Pre-Travel Request' for this trip including airfare, your flight should be in the system, and you then add it to your expense report
- Even though Rutgers already paid for it, they still want you to add it to a report, so make sure its linked to your report and shows up as an expense. If it‚Äôs not linked, you can add it as an expense, listing cost and a screenshot of your booking. Concur just won‚Äôt reimburse you for it since it was paid by Rutgers already
- NOTE: For overnight travel, reimbursement may generally be provided for up to one day before and one day after the start/end of the conference.
- Any additional costs resulting from combining personal travel with University business travel are the responsibility of the traveler. If extending travel for a non-business reason (on either the front or back end), a comparison transportation quote is required to confirm if any additional cost was incurred. Contact¬†UPS for further details (contact info below).
