## Conference Registration Payment Process

To pay for conference registration via check request:

- The conference organization must first be added as a supplier in PaymentWorks if they are not already in the Rutgers system
    - Ask the lab manager to check if they‚Äôre in PaymentWorks or add them
- Once supplier status is confirmed, obtain an invoice/quote from the conference showing registration fees
- Have the lab manager submit a check request through RU Marketplace with the invoice attached
- Timeline: Allow 3-4 weeks for the entire process (supplier setup + check request processing)

## Travel and Accommodations

üö® IMPORTANT: Is your travel being sponsored by/charged to a federal R01 grant? If so, check over these documents, as your restrictions/procedures may differ from general policy:
- [General Considerations/Differences](https://rutgers.box.com/s/c2tyz5h94zvp0nr64bq0u9qr0yrb70o6)
-[Airfare and travel booking policies](https://rutgers.box.com/s/la4lpkb602ff4ezuqjdgfs7b4v5coehy)


There are two main steps for paying for travel and accommodations:

### Step 1: Pre-trip Request (create 24hrs before you want to book)

1. **Look up the cost of the accommodation, airfare, expected costs, etc. which you expect to use during your travel.**
    
    Take screenshots and/or note down prices, but don‚Äôt book yet.
    
    [Tutorial: Booking Airfare and Lodging](https://rutgers.box.com/s/2uf18n3ifisivweawnhiaeownjy4ulw8)
    
    If you want to see what is allowed (when are first-class tickets allowed? How much baggage can I pay for? Etc.) look in this itemized tutorial:
    
    [Tutorial: What is reimbursable?](https://rutgers.box.com/s/8pde44tv6c9egwlsbo4oxfntx7su0lt7)
    

1. **Create a pre-travel request in Concur**
    
    [Tutorial: Create Pre-travel Request](https://rutgers.box.com/s/q51ovbgxffd55mvxczcif7758qt9mvse)
    
    Include things like flight, lodging, per-diem amounts, transportation needs, business dinners, and other expected costs.
    
    Again, if you want to figure out exactly what you can include, check here: ¬†[Tutorial: What is reimbursable?](https://rutgers.box.com/s/8pde44tv6c9egwlsbo4oxfntx7su0lt7)
    
    Your pre-travel request may include estimates of what everything will cost in your trip. Though, it is not necessary to have the accurate information in the pre-travel request-- you can always submit more/less in the actual expense report. The benefit is that if your expense report submission is within 10% of your approved pre-travel request amount, your reimbursement will be fast-tracked and approved very quickly
    

1. **Make your bookings 24 hours later (or as soon as John Nguyen Cleary approves it, whichever comes first)**
    
    *(He doesn‚Äôt need to approve it to make your bookings‚Äîif he doesn‚Äôt reject within 24 hours, you‚Äôre approved to book)*
    

### Step 2: Book hotels, transportation and airfare

**Airfare, train tickets:**

- ONLY through concur
- [Tutorial for booking](https://rutgers.box.com/s/2uf18n3ifisivweawnhiaeownjy4ulw8)


‚úàÔ∏èNote: You CANNOT submit for reimbursement of flights/trains booked outside of Concur. But booking through Concur = Rutgers pays directly, no out of pocket


**Lodging:** 

- Can be through concur, can also book anywhere and submit for reimbursement
    - Airbnb, hotels outside of concur, splitting rooms/lodging, etc.
    - Just submit for reimbursement after
    - So if you want to share a room with someone else, you can both pay half and then submit for reimbursement
- [Tutorial for booking](https://rutgers.box.com/s/2uf18n3ifisivweawnhiaeownjy4ulw8)

üíµ You can also request ‚Äúcash advances‚Äù to cover per diem amounts, instead of paying out of pocket, if you want to 
[Cash Advances Tutorial](https://holmeslab.github.io/holmeslab/docs/Travel/cash-advance/)
[Cash Advances tutorial video](https://rutgersconnect.sharepoint.com/sites/TravelExpenseBPR/_layouts/15/stream.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FTravelExpenseBPR%2FShared)

Otherwise, just check the per diem for your city and spend in accordance, then submit for reimbursement after (no receipts or documentation needed)


### Step 3: Registration

Fill out [this form](https://rutgers.box.com/s/v30d71j6zytqyaqsqtnk0r63im0ruut3) to complete registration ONLY if you‚Äôre travelling internationally AND you‚Äôre a student (undergrad or PhD) at Rutgers

### Step 4: During travel: pay out of pocket

Keep Required Documentation!

- [List: Documentation Needed](https://rutgers.box.com/s/7dmtb6ignsrxim5pqgpufd3v4beiq7qe)

Check which expenses are reimbursable: 

- [List: what is reimbursable?](https://rutgers.box.com/s/8pde44tv6c9egwlsbo4oxfntx7su0lt7)

### Step 5: Submit a Travel Expense Report for Reimbursement

**TUTORIAL:** for [Creating a Travel Expense Report in Concur](https://rutgers.box.com/s/8mzht4kydhgb4n9bczku5u8jeb303hrc)

Overview: 

- Click ‚ÄòStart a Report º
- Fill out your expenses, including receipts and information
    - List of [what documentation info / receipt types to include](https://rutgers.box.com/s/7dmtb6ignsrxim5pqgpufd3v4beiq7qe) for non-per-diem reimbursements: 
    -[What expenses are reimbursable?](https://rutgers.box.com/s/8pde44tv6c9egwlsbo4oxfntx7su0lt7)
- Fill in Holmes Lab purchasing codes: in Box at /Lab_admin/Purchasing_codes
- If you have a pre-approved request in Concur, and your final expense report
that you submit is within 10% of your approved expenses, it will be auto-
approved!

**TIMELINE:** 

- To be completed ASAP upon return from travel and/or when business expenses are incurred, within 60 days.
- Can only be submitted after all expenses are incurred
    - So if you‚Äôre travelling for a conference and you pay for an Airbnb in advance, you can only submit for reimbursement AFTER the conference is over, even if you‚Äôve paid before the conference

### Step 6: Any other forms if necessary

**Lost Receipt Certification Form**
- Required for any expense for which a receipt/proof of payment cannot be provided.
- Complete form, have it signed by supervisor, and include as an attachment with Expense Report

**Higher Level Approval Form**
Required for expenses older than 60 days.

- Per RU policy, expenses older than 60 days require next higher level approval
- Form must be signed by the employee‚Äôs supervisor and the next higher level individual
- Signed form must be included as an attachment with Expense Report
- Expenses older than one year are not reimbursable
