# Cash Advances
Cash advances are direct deposits into your linked bank account/reimbursement location in Concur. These are requested for a particular approved trip. It is often used to request the per-diem amount for the city you're travelling to. Then, you can get that money deposited into your account without having to pay out of pocket and wait for reimbursement. Any cash advance over $100/day needs special approval. 

You should request the cash advance **at the time of the pre-travel request**, at least a few weeks before your trip, and it will be deposited 2 weeks before your trip. You can try to submit it within 2 weeks of leaving, it's just not guaranteed that it will be approved/deposited. 

If you have already created and submitted the pre-travel request, you will not be able to add cash advances later. In order to add cash advances later you will have to delete your pre-travel request and make a new one.
