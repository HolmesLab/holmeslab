### Running Full Anatomical Analysis on FreeSurfer

**Running**

Open terminal **‚Üí** 

```jsx
recon-all \
  -i  <one slice in the anatomical dicom series> \
  -s  <subject id that you make up> \
  -sd <directory to put the subject folder in> \
  -all
```

- will take 5-20 hours

‚Äú-i file.dcm‚Äù

- only need to say 1 file in the set of ~180, it will find automatically the rest
- you can also use .nii files
- add ‚Äú-i file2.dcm‚Äù if you have two series of diff scans you want to run

‚Äú**bert**‚Äù 

- use whatever name you want it to be, maybe subject ID

### Terms

- **anatomically derived defect**
    
    A topological defect in the cortical surface that arises from a feature
    of normal neuroanatomy to be distinguished from defects arising entirely from segmentation errors. See topological defect
    
- **artifact**
    
    A feature that appears in an image but is not actually present in the imaged object.
    
- **average convexity**
    
    The signed distance that a vertex moves during the inflation process.
    
- **brain volume**
    
    The T1 volume after the skull and other non-brain structures have been removed. This volume can be viewed using tkmedit.
    
- **canonical surface**
    
    Surface-based atlas constructed from the cortical surfaces of 40 normal individuals (used for inter-subject averaging).
    
- **conversion/averaging**
    
    Process of converting and averaging multiple structural acquisitions from the native magnet format into the native [FreeSurfer](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FreeSurfer) format (see COR files).
    
- **COR files**
    
    The native file format used by [FreeSurfer](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FreeSurfer) to store 3D structural image data.
    
- **Euler number**
    
    After Leonhard Euler (1707-83). A topological invariant of a surface that can be computed from the number of edges, vertices and faces in a polygonal tessellation (command [mris_euler_number](http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/mris_euler_number) ). The Euler number of a sphere will equal 2; the Euler number of a surface with n handles is 2 ¬ñ 2n.
    
- **filled volume**
    
    The wm volume after separation of the left and right hemispheres and
    filling of each hemisphere. This volume can be viewed using tkmedit.
    
- **flattening**
    
    Producing a planar (flat) representation of a patch of the cortical surface that has minimal metric distortion.
    
- **gyrus**
    
    A fold or convolution of brain tissue (an outward folded region).
    
- **hypointensities (wm)**
    
    Dark white matter on a T1-weighted image.
    
- **hypointensities (non-wm)**
    
    Dark gray matter on a T1-weighted image.
    
- **inflated surface**
    
    The smoothwm surface after inflation. This surface can be viewed using surfer.
    
- **inflation**

    visual inspection.
    
- **intensity**
    
    Measured amount of magnetic field at a given spatial location, represented by a
    voxel (higher SNR signal to noise ratio means voxels will have a higher
    intensity relative to the background noise, and appear brighter).
    
- **label**
    
    A particular region of interest. e.g. in tksurfer the label would be a
    region of interest in the surface. In tkmedit a label is a region of

- **morphing**
    
    Computer graphics technique whereby a mapping is computed that smoothly transforms one image or surface into another.
    
- **morphometrics**
    
    The study of geometric properties of the human brain.

    An algorithm that groups voxels or sub-regions into larger regions.
    
- **RF-field inhomogeneities**
    
    Spatial variations in the Radio Frequency (RF) excitation pulse. These
    variations result in changes in the measured intensity for a given
    tissue class that are related to the spatial location of the voxel.
    
- **segmentation**
    
    Labeling of tissue classes from MRI data (e.g. white matter).

- **tessellation**
    
    Covering of a surface by repeated use of a single shape.
    
- **topology**
    
    The properties of a surface related to its connectivity that are unaffected by geometric (i.e. rubber sheet) transformations.
    
- **topological defect**
    
    A portion of a surface that results in the surface topology differing from that of a sphere.

    A 3-D data set that typically contains either intensity information
    derived from the original MRI, or the results of segmenting this data
    into tissue classes.
