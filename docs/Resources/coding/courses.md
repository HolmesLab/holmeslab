### Intro to Programming

- [Harvard’s CS50](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science) is a great high-level introduction to programming and software engineering that covers the fundamentals of Python.
- You may want to dive a little deeper though, for which [Programming Fundamentals](https://programming-23.mooc.fi/) by the University of Helsinki is great. You can probably skim through the first few chapters if you have worked through CS50.
- [Dead Simple Python](https://nostarch.com/dead-simple-python); to understand Python’s inner workings to use it for data science and machine learning, useful later on

### Shallow Machine Learning

- [Machine Learning Specialisation](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/machine-learning-specialization/) by Andrew Ng: Basics of ML, gateway to shallow ML

### Deep Learning

- If you liked Andrew Ng’s teaching style, you can continue with the [Deep Learning Specialisation](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/deep-learning-specialization/).
- For a more university-style course, there's Yann LeCun’s [NYU lecture](https://atcold.github.io/NYU-DLSP21/) on deep learning.
- For a more practical approach, [fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai/) and the accompanying book [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/Resources/book.html) got you covered.

### Maths:

- [deeplearning.ai](http://deeplearning.ai) has a course on the [Mathematics on Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/mathematics-for-machine-learning-and-data-science-specialization/).
-[This book](https://www.mathworks.com/academia/books/calculus-and-linear-algebra-in-recipes-karpfinger.html) was great. It has a lot of digestible chapters with practical examples that work for both, education and as a reference.
