## Machine Learning
### Overview
- [Making Friends with Machine Learning - 6hr Google Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vkb7BCMQd0)

### Classical ML
- [Machine Learning Specialisation](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/machine-learning-specialization/) by Andrew Ng: Basics of ML, gateway to shallow ML

### Deep Learning
- If you liked Andrew Ng’s teaching style, you can continue with the [Deep Learning Specialisation](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/deep-learning-specialization/).
- For a more university-style course, there's Yann LeCun’s [NYU lecture](https://atcold.github.io/NYU-DLSP21/) on deep learning.
- For a more practical approach, [fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai/) and the accompanying book [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/Resources/book.html) got you covered.
