### **Coding for Research Books**
- [Scientific Computing with Python](https://caam37830.github.io/book/introduction.html) by Brad Nelson
    - Tutorial based book about basics of using Python for scientific computing, including overviews and implementation of Python functions and common algorithms.
    - Good for beginners new to Python and coding for research.
- [The Good Research Code Handbook](https://goodresearch.dev/)
    - This handbook is for grad students, postdocs and PIs who do a lot of programming as part of their research. It teaches you how to organize your code so that it is easy to understand and works reliably.
    - Good for people who have some coding experience but want to improve their coding practices.
- [Better Code, Better Science by Russ Poldrack](https://poldrack.github.io/BetterCodeBetterScience)
    - Brief summaries of best practices for research coding in research, including version control, testing, and documentation.
    - Less implementation focused, more about theory and big ideas from software engineering that can and should be applied for research.
    - Good for people who have intermediate coding experience and want to apply software engineering principles.
