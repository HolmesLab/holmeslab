Adapted from [Aizenmann lab Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O5TLxTwemkVsYcV_yUZp9kZEN9NCVK9M9ldjMz16Id4/edit) & various other threads

## Books

Really interesting read about how the brain is put together from a bunch of seemingly scattered parts and biological processes. Any of his other books are good too.

**The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat - Oliver Sacks**

A classic, interesting case studies from the fringes of neurology. Also, all his other books are great, I also liked Awakenings.

**Neurotribes - Steve Silberman**

Incredibly good book about autism and autistic individuals, and the idea of neurodiversity. Really changed how I think of neurological disorders, very well written.

**Brain on Fire: My Month of Madness - Susannah Calahan**

Autobiographical case study of sudden onset psychosis, caused by something we talked a lot about in class (I won’t spoil it).

**Delusions of Gender - Cordelia Fine**

Great summary of the neuroscience of sex differences, had some controversy when it came out, but worth reading.

**A Primate’s Memoir - Robert Sapolsky**

A classic neuroscience book about baboons - neuroendocrinology, social hierarchy, very well written. One of my favorites.

**Think Tank - multiple authors**

A series of essays by forty neuroscientists about their favorite topics in neuroscience. Most are very good and insightful.

**An Alchemy of Mind - Diane Ackerman**

I have not read this yet, but her other books I really enjoyed. A bit more literary than the others, but always insightful.

**The Three Pound Enigma - Shannon Moffet**

Another entertaining and insightful book about how we study the brain.

**Phantoms in the Brain - VS Ramachandran**

Really good writer, more case studies but unlike Oliver Sacks it delves a little deeper into the mechanisms and neuroscience behind them.

**Autobiography of a Transgender Scientist - Ben Barres**

Well written account by an incredible neuroscientist.

**Time, Love, Memory - Jonathan Weiner**

Biography of Seymour Benzer and the founding of the field of behavioral genetics.

**How to Make a Zombie - Frank Swain**

Learn all about the science of zombies - head transplantation experiments, mind control, all sorts of fringe neuroscience.

**Unique: The New Science of Human Individuality – David Linden**

An interesting exploration of how the interactions between genes and environment shape who we are and what makes each of us different.

**Innate: How the wiring of our brains shapes who we are – Kevin Mitchell**

A nice complement to “Unique”. Further explorations in individuality, genes and development.

**The Entangled Brain: How Percetion, Cognition, and Emotion Are Woven Together – Luiz Pessoa**

A new take on a circuits level view of brain function.

**In Praise of Imperfection: My Life and Work - Rita Levi-Montalcini**

Neuroscientist, Nobel prize winner, Jewish during Mussolini's racial laws. She fled bringing with her the microscope and she setted up a clandestine laboratory at home.

**The tale of Dueling Neurosurgeons - Sam Kean**

True neuroscience stories about trauma, madness and recovery. A collection and explanation of all the case studies that allowed us to learn about the human brain, eg Phineas Gage. Author has a podcast, [The Disappearing Spoon](https://t.co/bj4WuWwX4I?amp=1)

**Musicophilia – Oliver Sacks**

There aren’t many books on music and the brain, this one is well written and accessible.

**How to Change Your Mind: What the new science of psychedelics teaches us about consciousness**

Michael Pollan always writes good books on everything from food to psylocibin. This one is quite interesting on a trendy topic.

**Neurogastronomy: How the bran creates flavor and why it matters  –  Gordon Shepherd**

A very deep dive into the neuroscience of food. It gets pretty deep into the neuroscience, but remains fairly accessible. Very interesting and insightful.

**Gastrophysics: The New Science of Eating – Charles Spence**

A bit more accessible, but a bit less neuroscience. Nevertheless its very engaging and will suck you in.

**Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay [@neurograce](https://x.com/neurograce)**

**The Entangled Brain by Luis Pessoa [@PessoaBrain](https://x.com/PessoaBrain)**

**A Brief History of Intelligence by Max Bennett [@maxsbennett](https://x.com/maxsbennett)**

My favorite general book on neuroscience for high school students, neuroscience grad students, neuroscience faculty and everyone in between is "A Brief History of Intelligence” -Tony Zadorv

**The Experience Machine by Andy Clark.**

**Ed Yong, An Immense World**

**'Touching a Nerve: The Self as Brain' by Patricia Churchland**

**History of Neuroscience in Autobiography: series from SfN**
