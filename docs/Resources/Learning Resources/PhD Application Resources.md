 Growing up in Science, a series started by Wei Ji Ma at New York University in 2014, features the personal narratives of scientists. In a typical event, one faculty member shares their life story with a focus on struggles, failures, doubts, and detours. Common topics include dealing with expectations, bad mentorship, impostor complex, procrastination, luck, rejection, conflicts with advisors, and work- life balance, but these topics are always embedded in the speaker’s broader narrative. Since its inception, Growing up in Science has  spread to many other institutions. It is now also a series of global online events, some of which have a special theme (e.g. anti-racism or mentorship).
