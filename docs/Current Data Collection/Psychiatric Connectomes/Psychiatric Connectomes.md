**Sample**: N=270 at McLean and Rutgers (135 at each site), over 4 years 

**Demographics**: Primary of Bipolar or SCZ, variety of severities, as well as comorbidities; Healthy controls 

### Aims

Objective:  **Establish connectome signatures, or ‚Äúfingerprints‚Äù, that co-vary with cognition, negative valence systems, and social functions in healthy and clinical samples, dissecting their associated genetic and cellular bases.**

**Questions to address:**
1) To what extent can brain function predict symptom profiles (cognition, negative valence, and social functions) across transdiagnostic cohorts, revealing the presence of clinical subgroups 

2) Can a predictive modeling approach establish network profiles that precede longitudinal change

3) Do cell type profiles recapitulate functional network organization in the general
population

4) Do these cellular associates of network function reveal genomic signatures that are co-heritable with psychiatric illness risk

### Surveys & Data Collection:

**Clinical Interview - Session 1**

1. Structured Clinical Interview - DSM V
    - In RedCAP for McLean, in CCNP protocols for Rutgers
    - At Rutgers, only diagnoses are communicated for participants, not SCID notes
    - At Rutgers, participants who have already done the SCID may do a ‚Äòrefresher‚Äô version of the SCID with only modules A, B & D
2. Ratings Interview
    - On Qualtrics: [PCX_ClinicalVisit_RatingsInterview](https://rutgers.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1TaMc3VH59wEeZo)
