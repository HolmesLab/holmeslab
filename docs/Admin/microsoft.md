## Microsoft Office for faculty and staff

All current faculty and staff at 
Rutgers have the ability to download and install Microsoft Office on 
personal devices through Rutgers Connect.

The university’s agreements with Microsoft allow faculty and staff to
 install Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Publisher, and 
Access on up to five computers, five tablets, and five phones.

Faculty and staff may use the Microsoft Office software on personal 
devices. Please consult with your department’s IT support staff before 
installing Office on Rutgers-owned devices, as your department may have 
its own policies.

Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Outlook, Skype, OneDrive,
 Publisher (PC only) and Access (PC only) are included in each 
installation of a faculty/staff license for Office.

### **How to access Microsoft Office**

To access this service, faculty and staff must [log into their Rutgers Connect account](https://connect.rutgers.edu/).

For additional instructions on how to install Microsoft Office, please visit the [How to Install webpage](https://ithelp.rutgers.edu/sp?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0012556).

Microsoft Office mobile apps are also available to download for iOS and Android devices:

- [Office apps for iOS](https://products.office.com/en-us/mobile/office-mobile-apps-for-ios)

### **How long do I have the Microsoft Office products for?**

All faculty and staff will have an active license to use Microsoft 
Office products while they are employed at Rutgers. Once a faculty or 
staff member departs the University, the license will expire. A faculty 
or staff member will have 30 days after losing the faculty/staff role 
before the Office applications go into a read-only mode with limited 
functionality.
