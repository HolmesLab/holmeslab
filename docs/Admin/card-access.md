To get card access for CAHBIR building, send a request with your NetID to cahbir-support@rutgers.edu, and say how long you will need access to CAHBIR. Jeff/Rose will then send a request to Jeff Grek at facilities grekje@rwjms.rutgers.edu.

To get access to the MRI suite, after you finish L1 training, Jeff will send a request to Jeff Grek to get you access to the MRI suite first door (with waiting room, changing room, etc). Once you pass L2 training, he'll request your access to the control room.  

To get access to RWJMS Research Tower (where the UBHC cafeteria and CCNP are) and Kessler (where Woody's is), fill out the below form, have Avram sign it, and send it to lucijam@rwjms.rutgers.edu.
