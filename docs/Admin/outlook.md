# Add Outlook Calendar to Google Calendar

Date: July 7, 2025 12:47 PM

To show your Outlook email calendar (like your @rutgers email, or other university/corporate emails) on your Google Calendar, you can subscribe to a live link (so it stays updated) using an iCal URL. Here's how to do that:

---

## Step 1: Get the Outlook Calendar iCal URL

### If you're using Outlook.com:

1. Go to [Outlook.com calendar](https://outlook.live.com/calendar/).
2. On the left pane, right-click the calendar you want to sync (e.g., “Calendar”) → click "Sharing and permissions".
3. In the sharing popup:
    - Under “Share with people”, type your own email address (or any dummy one).
    - Choose “Can view all details”.
    - Click “Share”, then click the “ICS” link that appears.
    - Copy the ICS link (this is the live iCal link).

### If you're using Outlook on Office 365 / Exchange (work or school):

1. Go to [Outlook on the web](https://outlook.office365.com/calendar/).
2. Click on the gear icon > “View all Outlook settings”.
3. Go to Calendar > Shared calendars.
4. Under “Publish a calendar”:
    - Choose the calendar.
    - Choose permissions like “Can view all details”.
    - Click “Publish”.
    - Copy the ICS link shown below.

## Step 2: Add the Calendar to Google Calendar

1. Go to [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/).
2. On the left panel, next to “Other calendars”, click the “+” icon > “From URL”.
3. Paste the ICS link from Outlook.
4. Click “Add calendar”.

This will now display your Outlook calendar in Google Calendar. It is a read-only live sync, meaning it updates periodically (Google polls the ICS feed every few hours), but you can’t edit Outlook events from Google.

## Rename the Calendar in Google

1. After it’s added, go to Settings (gear icon) > Settings.
2. Under “Settings for other calendars,” select the calendar you just added.
3. You can change the name, color, and notifications here.
