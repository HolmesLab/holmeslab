## Tips on Submissions
- All documents submitted in ‘clean’ and ‘tracked’ forms
- Clean version of each document and tracked version showing the changes from the last approved version of this document
    - Save as <name>_clean.docx and <name>_tracked.docx
    - Easiest to copy the clean version of the approved document, select Review > “Track Changes” on Word, then make your edits for that amendment. Once you’re ready to submit, duplicate the tracked version and then select Review > “Accept All Changes” to create a clean version with all your updates
    - If you have a clean version of the updated file, create a tracked version of this by going to Review > Compare > Compare Documents. Upload the original version and then the new version, and it will create a new document for you.
- Use lay-person language- IRB staff are not experts in your field
- Don’t use undefined acronyms or jargon
- Don’t use Google docs / excel for data storage or study documents storage - not approved for research purposes
    - If you’re using Rutgers-sponsored application for data storage/software, like MS Office, Box etc, reference that they’re Rutgers
    - If you’re using not Rutgers-sponsored, you must include the app privacy information


## How to Add People to eIRB
1. Sign into with your NetID
    1. Make sure your profile lists the correct affiliation
    2. Make sure you’ve completed your necessary CITI courses (Aka Basic course: social-behavioral research OR Basic Course: biomedical study)
2. First page— select “Rutgers Health and Biomedical Sciences” Because we’re under RWJHS
3. If study staff or co-investigators have completed CITI courses but they weren’t submitted via their Rutgers email and they haven’t transferred over, you can attach the CITI certificate of completion in the “Additional Supporting Documents” page 
    1. See steps below for doing CITI courses
4. If you have Co-investigators, select “Notify co-investigators” in ***My Activities***. They need to accept the invitation to be a co-investigator.
5. Each person (co-investigators, study staff, etc) all must complete and submit a eCOI financial disclosure form (see steps below)
6. If you are ready to submit, the PI must submit the study under his/her ***My Activities*** section. (Study coordinator, staff, collaborators etc. cannot do this, only the single specified PI)
7. If you get reviewer notes, you can find them in the “History” section or “Reviewer Notes” section
    1. You must ‘reply’ to each comment by the reviewer, as well as fixing it

### Reporting to IRB
[**Didn’t Expect that to Happen: Events that must be Reported Promptly to the IRB**](https://info.advarra.com/didnt-expect-that-to-happen-wbnr-od)


## How to Create a Modification
1. Create folder in the relevant IRB folder named by the amendment number (eg `MS3` for Rutgers). 
2.  For the documents you want to edit in this modification, copy the most recent approved version of that doc from the Currently Approved Docs folder
3.  Create a tracking document (text file or word doc) in the folder called `MS#_description_of_changes`.
4.  Rename the document from "_clean" to "_tracked". Open the document to edit and turn on 'tracking changes' (under 'Review' tab).
5.  Create any changes you'd like to make for the modification, with tracking on.
6.  Describe all the changes you make in the  AME#_description_of_changes doc.
7.  Once you've made all the changes necessary, create a clean version of the document by duplicating the "_tracked" document, renaming the copy to "`_clean`", opening the document in word, highlight the whole document with command+A, click Review > Track Changes > Accept all changes. Now there should be a popup saying "there are no tracked changes in your document." Press "OK" and then save the document. Now this document should reflect all the newest changes without any actual 'tracking' marking up the document.
7.  Upload the `_tracked` and `_clean` versions of the document to the modification in eIRB
8.  Copy and paste the description of changes into the relevant field for the modification
9.  When it gets approved, add the ReviewLetter to [`Approval_letters`] folder (if relevant)
10.  Update all the new approved docs in the Currently Approved Docs folder, so that it reflects the most recent docs



## File structure

- Files located at `/Box-Box/Holmes_Lab_Wiki/Active_IRBs`
- Files should be tracked using this structure:
    
    **Original Submission Folder Structure**
    
    ```bash
    ├── orig_ProNUMBER # ProXXXXXX
    │   ├── Protocol 
    │   ├── Scales
    │   ├── Consent 
    │   ├── Attachments 
    
    ```
    
    **Example Amendment Folder Structure**
    
    ```bash
    
    ├── MS3_in_progress #change to 'approved' or 'rejected' when updated
    │   ├──  Attachments
    │   │   ├── CAHBIR MRI Participant Screening Form.pdf
    │   │   └── MGB_Local_Context_Form_IRB_Protocol-Specific.pdf
    │   ├── Consent
    │   │   ├── R01_Consent_Form_250403_clean.docx
    │   │   └── R01_Consent_Form_250403_tracked.docx
    │   ├── CCNP Recruitment Materials
    │   │   ├── Example Reddit Post CCNP.png
    │   │   ├── Flyer CCNP.pdf
    │   │   ├── Holmes_01_CON_Flyer.pdf
    │   │   └── Holmes_01_SCZ_MDD_BP_Flyer.pdf
    │   └── changes_MS3.txt
    ```
    
    **Current Approved Docs folder**
    
    - Put the most current approved versions of docs
    - This is because the updated docs will be scattered across multiple amendment folders making it difficult to keep track of what is the most current form without going to the IRB website or looking through all folders
    
    ```bash
    ├── current_approved_docs
    │   ├── Protocol 
    │   ├── Scales
    │   ├── Consent
    │   ├── Attachments
    ```
