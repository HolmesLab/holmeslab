**Common Procurement FAQs for Holmes Lab:**

- **What do I do if a supplier gives me an agreement/contract to sign?**
    
    Do not sign any agreement. Units do not have authority to sign supplier agreements on behalf of the University.  Agreements requiring signature must be forwarded to University Procurement Services for signature; the corresponding requisition number should also be included.
    
- **A supplier contacted my unit saying they have not received my purchase order. What to do?**
    
    First, if the supplier doesn‚Äôt need your purchase order to issue an invoice, and you already have an invoice, you can just email that invoice to [accountspayable@finance.rutgers.edu](mailto:accountspayable@finance.rutgers.edu). 
    
    The process for a supplier getting a purchase order is that Rutgers will automatically send the PO to the email that supplier listed in PaymentWorks. You can look at history of the purchase order in RU Marketplace to ensure that Rutgers has sent¬†the purchase order. It will have a field of ‚ÄúEmail (HTML Attachment)‚Äù listing what email the PO was sent to, and ‚ÄúDistribution Date/Time‚Äù
    
    (If Rutgers hasn‚Äôt sent the PO, that‚Äôs weird, inquire with UPS to ask why using the [University Procurement Services Help Desk](https://rutgers.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_4MfeqH34iMABCo6))
    
    Ask the supplier to check that email for the PO at the distribution date/time
    
    However, that email may be out of service or no longer accessible. If that‚Äôs the case, download the PO by going to the PO, clicking the 3 dots ‚Äú. . .‚Äù button > ‚ÄúPrint Fax Version‚Äù > Save to PDF. (Don‚Äôt use the printer icon, that will print out a version which doesn‚Äôt have all the information). Then email this to your supplier. 
    
- **Can I book/pay for a hotel/airbnb outside of Concur and be reimbursed?**
    
    Yes, just submit for reimbursement. Include the estimated cost (doesn‚Äôt have to be exact) of the lodging payment when you make your pre-travel request.
    

# Detailed Process

## 1. Check for Supplier Contract

1. See if the supplier is in RU Marketplace
    1. Go to [http://my.rutgers.edu](http://my.rutgers.edu) ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Supplier Portal ‚Üí Vendor Master Updates
        1. Search for their name in ‚ÄòVendor Name‚Äô and ‚ÄòCompany Name‚Äô
    2. If they don‚Äôt, follow this doc:
    
    [Invite a New Supplier to PaymentWorks- US/Canada Suppliers](https://www.notion.so/Invite-a-New-Supplier-to-PaymentWorks-US-Canada-Suppliers-286cf00eb936809791f4dd79719d7f66?pvs=21)
    

## 2. Figure out which purchase form you use to pay for this

1. Try to find your item in the [Non-PO Transaction Matrix sheet](https://rutgers.box.com/s/od35jddjazp5fik32lzs9kt800tp8jjt) ‚Üí this tells you what form + additional documents to use
2. Try to find it in [Commodity Codes - Which Forms are Allowed](https://rutgers.box.com/s/4hdapczpt2l3wklkauijaultrvw9q9zf) ‚Üí this tells you what form to use
    
    ‚Üí from both these lists choose the best category
    
    ‚Üí then see which purchase forms are allowed
    

Matrix for figuring out what form to use:

- Is it an item?
    - Is it under $50k?
        - Is it a restricted item? (see below for list)
            - No ‚Üí Use Quick Order
            - Yes ‚Üí Look in [Non-PO Transaction Matrix sheet](https://rutgers.box.com/s/od35jddjazp5fik32lzs9kt800tp8jjt) / [Commodity Codes - Which Forms are Allowed](https://rutgers.box.com/s/4hdapczpt2l3wklkauijaultrvw9q9zf)  to see what purchase form to use
- Is it a service?
    - Use service request
- **Restricted Items**
    - Animals
    - Biological agents
    - Branded Promotional Merchandise
    - Controlled substances
    - Equipment that requires a utilities hook-up
    - Furniture, carpeting and window treatments
    - Hazardous waste disposal
    - Imported equipment that requires customs clearance
    - Plaques to be affixed on buildings or University-owned property and monuments
    - Radioactive materials
    - Select agents and toxins
    - **Services**
        - Business
        - Information Technology
        - Leases
        - Legal
        - Lobbying
        - Professional
    - Software Licenses including all¬†Cloud-Based Purchases and Web Applications

### About Types of Purchase Forms

- Quick order is for all non-restricted, under 50k items
- Check requests needed for some items or other forms in ‚Äòrestricted items‚Äô OR if it‚Äôs in the  [Non-PO Transaction Matrix sheet](https://rutgers.box.com/s/od35jddjazp5fik32lzs9kt800tp8jjt) (ie *human subjects payments, conference registration*, etc) and says ‚Äòcheck request‚Äô
    
    <aside>
    ‚úÖ
    
    **Check Requests in [RU Marketplace](https://solutions.sciquest.com/apps/Router/SAMLAuth/Rutgers)**
    We receive and approve the request and process payment to the supplier. 
    For more information, see the¬†[check request process](https://procurementservices.rutgers.edu/resources/how-to/pay/initiate-check-request).
    
    Be sure to:
    
    - Refer to the check request matrix to determine if the request is a purchase order or a check request
    - Use the proper account code
    - Electronically submit required supporting documents with the check request
    
    For Foreign Addresses, an International Wire Transfer Form will 
    need to be completed as well as the Check Request by the submitting 
    department. The department must note on the Check Request that they will
     be requesting a Wire for this payment, otherwise a Paper Check will be 
    printed, and the department will have to have the payment canceled and 
    restart the process.
    
    </aside>
    
- Some items in Non-PO transaction matrix need Non-PO Upload
    
> 
    üîë
    
    **Non-PO Uploads in RU Marketplace**
    Non-PO Uploads make it simple to submit a payment request for 
    multiple individuals at once and allow you to track the status of the 
    request. The process also ensures that the payments meet University 
    requirements, as well as the IRS rules that govern the taxation of 
    payments to individuals.
    
    This process can be used to pay individuals for:
    
    - Human subject payments/direct disbursements (to Principal Investigator)
    - Non-employee refunds
    - Non-qualifying scholarships (formerly stipends)
    - Travel and Business Expense Reimbursement for Non-Rutgers/Visitor
    - Petty Cash¬†**(pending Accounting approval*)**
    - Patient refunds
    - Royalties¬†(print royalties are processed via the [Candex punchout](https://solutions.sciquest.com/apps/Router/Home?tmstmp=1753083966110))
    - Legal Payments (OGC USE ONLY)
    
    **Please note -** if the type of request falls under Non-PO Upload, but it is for a non-US resident, then the individual will need to be setup thru PaymentWorks as a Supplier. The¬†department will need to submit a Check Request and International Wire Transfer¬†for payment.
    
    In order to submit non-PO uploads for payment, you must complete the Non-PO Upload Request Form in¬†[RU Marketplace](https://solutions.sciquest.com/apps/Router/SAMLAuth/Rutgers), using the¬†[Instructions for Non-PO Upload Requests](https://rutgers.instructure.com/courses/561/modules/items/6237375)¬†for guidance.
    
    End-users must use the Commodity Code "Wires, Prepayment, Uploads" on the Shopping Cart page for Non-PO Uploads.
    
    
- Service request needed for any professional service or independent contractor

## 3. Fill out additional documents based on type of purchase form needed to submit:

- **Quick order**: just invoice/quote
- **Check request**: just invoice/quote
- **Service Request:** invoice/quote, Statement of Work and ICED form
- **Check request**: invoice/quote, variable

*Restricted items may have additional needed forms, such as [Third Party Risk Assessment](https://rusecure.rutgers.edu/third-party-security-review-process)  for software

Also check if the supplier has a specific Rutgers Contract, to see if there are specific additional documents‚Äî

1. If they‚Äôre in RU marketplace, look up their (supplier contract) name in [https://procurementservices.rutgers.edu/purchasing/find-products-and-services?category=All](https://procurementservices.rutgers.edu/purchasing/find-products-and-services?category=All) to see any additional docuemnts needed
    1. Scroll to ‚ÄòProcurement Procedures‚Äô section, it will list the necessary steps / forms
        1. Ex: for Dropbox [https://procurementservices.rutgers.edu/purchasing/dropbox-inc](https://procurementservices.rutgers.edu/purchasing/dropbox-inc) the procurement procedures section says purchasing requires:
            - Using the¬†[Service Request Form](https://solutions.sciquest.com/apps/Router/SAMLAuth/Rutgers)
                - Attaching a ‚Äúdetailed‚Äù quote
            - Submitting + attaching a [Third Party Risk Assessment](https://rusecure.rutgers.edu/third-party-security-review-process)
            
- Attaching these additional documents to requisitions
    - INTERNAL CORRESPONDENCE should be attached once to an internal link within the requisition.
        - Internal emails
        - Quotes other than Winning Quote
        - Spending request approvals
        - Business purpose forms
        - [Waiver of Bid Request Form](https://procurementservices.rutgers.edu/files/waiver-of-bid-request-form1pdf)
        - [Informal Bid Intake Form](https://procurementservices.rutgers.edu/files/informal-bid-intake-form0pdf)
        - ICED Form
    - EXTERNAL CORRESPONDENCE need to be attached once to an external link within the requisition.
        - Winning Supplier Quote
        - Proposals/Estimates/Invoices
        - Agreements
        - UPS Statement of Work (SOW) (when required)
        - UPS Supplemental Statement of Work (SSOW) (when required)

*Attaching documents to the correct requisition link helps speed up the requisition review and approval process.*

## 4. Figure out which Account Code (aka Expenditure Type) to use

1. If your item is a Non-PO transaction, it may have a ‚Äòrecommended account code‚Äô in the column
2. Common account codes:
    1. 56060 - travel + conference registration fees
    - 55250 -  Publication fees
    - 56100 - travel meals per diem
    - 56090 - travel lodging, foreign
    - 56080 - travel lodging, domestic
    - 52950 - Office supplies general
    - 52930 - Office supplies computer
    - 58030 - Computer Software Licenses & Fees
    - 74108 - anything (mac etc) from kite+key
    - 74105 - Parking pass permits
3. Look in [SAS Recommended Account Codes](https://rutgers.box.com/s/mrnx5wg8w5rhbiixzs9i9mjoternm231) - this is for school of arts and sciences which we are not, but still an applicable reference, more readable than the whole spreadsheet
4. Look in this [**master spreadsheet of account codes](https://rutgers.box.com/s/lujk9fm9n5jwju52cfvkoqkp8q0o32pn), pages 104-166**
5. If you don‚Äôt know still, ask UPS Helpdesk or Cynthia Duncan Robinson [robinsce@rwjms.rutgers.edu](mailto:robinsce@rwjms.rutgers.edu) (Program Assistant, RWJMS Dept. of Psychiatry Research)

## 5. Fill out and Submit Quick Order (/ other form)‚Ä¶

Go to RU Marketplace ‚Üí View Forms ‚Üí [select relevant form]

- Fill out all starred boxes, but don‚Äôt worry about any boxes that aren‚Äôt starred
- Attach invoice as internal attachment and external attachment, just to be safe
- If sending a physical check (the supplier would have chosen this in paymentworks), you can add special handling to the check in the ‚ÄúSpecial Handling‚Äù box
    - Can ask to send the check to a certain department
    - Include here if any backup documentation is required with the check
    - If you want a specific person noted on the envelope
    - If this payment is an international wire transfer
    
    The PO will be placed and confirmed. 
    
    1. PO created
    2. PO approved, ‚Äòsent to supplier‚Äô (sent as an HTML attachment to the email listed in paymentworks)
        1. Payment would still be subject to their net terms. Most suppliers are net45.
    - the PO will be sent to the email address listed in PaymentWorks
        - If that email is wrong, and you want the supplier to get the PO directly, it needs to be changed in PaymentWorks, but it‚Äôs an annoying process.
            
            
    - You can just send the PO directly to the supplier via email, by going to the PO, and pressing ‚Äúprint‚Äù and saving the printed version as a PDF, and sending that to supplier
    

## 6. Email invoice to [accountspayable@finance.rutgers.edu](mailto:accountspayable@finance.rutgers.edu)

1. Add the PO number to the invoice
2. Send an email [accountspayable@finance.rutgers.edu](mailto:accountspayable@finance.rutgers.edu) with the **PO number in the subject line**, and in the email body, with the **invoice attached**. 
    - It‚Äôs typically the supplier‚Äôs job to do this, but you do NOT have to wait for the supplier. If you have the invoice from the beginning, as soon as the PO number is generated and approved (is ‚Äòsent to supplier‚Äô), you can add that PO number to the invoice and email it to [accountspayable@finance.rutgers.edu](mailto:accountspayable@finance.rutgers.edu)
    - The supplier may do this and if so the invoice will be in RU marketplace
    - Email MUST contain PO NUMBER
3. After you send the email, you‚Äôll get an email from [noreply.jaggaer_AP@trustflowds.com](mailto:noreply.jaggaer_AP@trustflowds.com) with whether it was successful.
    - **Example of successful invoice email**
        
        Thank you for submitting your invoice. This notice confirms that we received your email to [accountspayable@finance.rutgers.edu](mailto:accountspayable@finance.rutgers.edu). All invoices must reference a VALID purchase order number. If there is no valid purchase order number, you will receive a separate rejection notice and the invoice will not be processed.
        
        The status of the email attachments is shown below:
        
        Valid Attachments:
        
        1457125461.pdf Attachment Size - 34.632KB
        
        Rejected Attachments:
        
        If there are rejected attachments listed above, and those attachments are invoices that require payment, please resend the attachment in the correct format. Valid attachment types are PDF, TIF, Microsoft Word (doc, docx) and JPG.
        
        Please note, this is an unmonitored email. ANY FORM OF Inquiries should be directed to¬†Help Desk Intake Form (
        
        [https://rutgers.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_4MfeqH34iMABCo6](https://rutgers.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_4MfeqH34iMABCo6)

## 7. Invoice is created and processed, payment is sent

1. Now on your PO/Requisition, Rutgers will create an Invoice under ‚Äúrelated documents‚Äù, with a Rutgers-unique invoice number (it will not match the supplier‚Äôs documentation of that invoice number)
2. The invoice page will list all relevant payment information- and when / whether it‚Äôs been paid
    1. Before payment, in the box **Payment Information**, **Payment Date** and **Payment Number** will be blank. Once the payment has been mailed/wired, those fields will be filled in. 
    2. **Pay Status** will also list when it has been paid. 
    - **Example of a fully paid invoice:**
        
        ![Screenshot 2025-03-31 at 9.40.37‚ÄØAM.png](Goods%20Check%20Request%20Quick%20Order%20e99908d36de24a76974180433918ec08/Screenshot_2025-03-31_at_9.40.37_AM.png)
        

1. Once payment is sent, if the supplier has indicated electronic payment (ACH), the payment is filed through that method. 
    1. if the supplier has indicated physical check, it goes via regular postal mail. The guidance we give is that it could take up to 10 days to arrive.
    2. This choice is done in paymentworks BY YOU WHEN YOU INVITE THE SUPPLIER
2. If the supplier doesn‚Äôt get the payment, or if you have questions, you can ask UPS (via a ticket) for a screenshot of the payment processing page in Oracle. They‚Äôll be able to send you information about where exactly the supplier‚Äôs payment was sent, to what bank, etc. 
    1. Here you can check if there‚Äôs any difference between the remittance information indicated on the supplier‚Äôs invoice, and the information in the payment details
    - **Example of a Oracle payment page**
        
        ![Inv-OL-206638_payment.png](Goods%20Check%20Request%20Quick%20Order%20e99908d36de24a76974180433918ec08/Inv-OL-206638_payment.png)
        

## If the supplier does not have a contract:

1. Find a contact person + email for the supplier company
    1. You‚Äôll have to work with them to get them set up in the Rutgers system as a supplier in PaymentWorks
    2. Notify them that an invitation will be coming their way / ask them if they will accept it
2. Follow this Job Aid: [Supplier Onboarding Course Pathway in Canvas](https://rutgers.instructure.com/courses/31949/pages/job-aid-inviting-a-new-supplier-and-checking-onboarding-status?module_item_id=6484653) 
    1. Choose ‚ÄòPO‚Äô, then ‚ÄòACH‚Äô (unless they request a physical check mailed, then select ‚ÄòCheck‚Äô), and select ‚ÄòWeb Email PDF‚Äô
    2. After you [submit your invitation on PaymentWorks](https://www.paymentworks.com/app), you‚Äôll be able to see the progress on there, as well as get emails
3. This is the email you‚Äôll get when your PaymentWorks invitation has been approved and sent to your supplier
    
    ![Screen Shot 2024-04-01 at 4.51.32 PM.png](Goods%20Check%20Request%20Quick%20Order%20e99908d36de24a76974180433918ec08/Screen_Shot_2024-04-01_at_4.51.32_PM.png)
    
4. This is the email they‚Äôll get from PaymentWorks
    
    ![Screen Shot 2024-04-01 at 4.42.09 PM.png](Goods%20Check%20Request%20Quick%20Order%20e99908d36de24a76974180433918ec08/Screen_Shot_2024-04-01_at_4.42.09_PM.png)
    
    5. This is the email you‚Äôll get when they open/ start registration in PaymentWorks
    
    ![Screen Shot 2024-04-01 at 4.43.08 PM.png](Goods%20Check%20Request%20Quick%20Order%20e99908d36de24a76974180433918ec08/Screen_Shot_2024-04-01_at_4.43.08_PM.png)
    
    6. Once the supplier finishes their PaymentWorks portal, this is what PaymentWorks will look like
    
    ![Screen Shot 2024-04-01 at 4.55.11 PM.png](Goods%20Check%20Request%20Quick%20Order%20e99908d36de24a76974180433918ec08/Screen_Shot_2024-04-01_at_4.55.11_PM.png)
    
    1.  Look up which commodity code you‚Äôll need in this form: [Commodity Codes - Which Forms Are Allowed](https://rutgers.box.com/s/4hdapczpt2l3wklkauijaultrvw9q9zf) (downloaded from Canvas link [List: Commodity Codes)](https://rutgers.instructure.com/courses/561/pages/list-commodity-codes-with-corresponding-forms?module_item_id=6208614) and make sure to use whichever form it says is allowable (ie Goods Request, Service Request or Quick Order)
