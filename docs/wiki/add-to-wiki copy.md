# Policies for Adding Content
Date Updated: May 1st, 2025

[Page in progress]

### Goal of this wiki: 
Store non-private information from the lab in a easy-to-navigate structure where people can find information and the right links. Allow it to be maintained by everyone in the lab and added to over time with the most up-to-date information. 

### What to add 
- Tutorials of technical or administrative processes
- Resources for learning, doing science or working in Academia
- Statements of Procedure for experiments or lab processes
- Code tutorials or documentation, especially for lab-relevant analysis tools or pipelines that many people may use
- Links, templates and forms for administrative or experimental processes
- Anything else non-sensitive that could be helpful to others in the lab!

### What not to add
- Any phone numbers or personal emails
- Any sensitive lab information like purchasing codes, passwords, etc
- Academic projects or results -- please host these on the Holmes Lab Github as separate repositories
- News from the lab, papers, research findings -- please ask the lab manager to add these on the lab website!

### Privacy norms
- Use 'invite only' links to box for anything internal/sensitive, or any big files,
- For really sensitive stuff, donâ€™t even do a link, just a file path
- For emails, replace '@' with # so that it can't be scraped off the site
- Don't add phone numbers unless it's general line which are easily accessible from other websites (ie general help lines for administrative departments)

### Content norms
- Make it simple - try to write in the most clear and concise way to optimize for the most useable tutorials/documentation
- Consider what will be useful to the most people in the future -- write it with the intention that someone years down the line may try to replicate your process with this documentation
