# What is an MRI?
MRI are ways to scan your head and take pictures of your brain using magnetic fields. This is NOT radiation (not like an X-ray), and there is no known harm associated with MRI scanning. However, there are some people who we don’t scan due to potential risks. For example, we don’t scan people who are pregnant, or people who have certain types of metal implants in their body. You will be thoroughly screened for these criteria through a survey you will complete before MRI scheduling and on the day of the scan. 

## What will happen before the MRI?
- You will be asked to remove jewelry, eyeglasses, hearing aids, hairpins, removable dental work or other objects that may interfere with the procedure.
- You will put all your items into a locked locker during the MRI 
- You will be given MRI-safe prescription eyeglasses if you wear them
- You will be asked to change into a scrub top, and to take off your shoes, but you can keep your clothes on from the waist down (pants etc). 

## What will happen during the MRI?
- You will lie on a scan table that slides into a circular opening of the scanning machine. Pillows and a headrest will be used to prevent movement during the procedure.
- The space is small and you will have a apparatus on your head similar to a football helmet/mask.
- The technologist will be in another room where the scanner controls are located. However, you will be in constant sight of the technologist through a window. Speakers inside the scanner will enable the technologist to communicate with and hear you. You will have a communication ball so that you can let the technologist know if you have any problems during the procedure. The technologist will be watching you at all times and will be in constant communication.
- You will be given earbuds to be able to hear the sounds for various tasks and movies shown. You will also be given pads by your ears to help muffle sounds and keep your head still.
- During the scanning process, the scanner is loud. A clicking noise and other sounds will sound. The scanner will also lightly vibrate at some points. The scanner is quite loud and we do everything we can to muffle sounds. 
    - An example of MRI sounds can be viewed here: [MRI Sounds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvXoHU9Cexk&pp=0gcJCfwAo7VqN5tD)
- It will be important for you to remain very still during the examination, as any movement could cause distortion and affect the quality of the scan.
- Once the scan is complete, the table will slide out of the scanner and you will be helped off the table.

While the MRI procedure itself causes no pain, having to lie still for the length of the procedure may cause discomfort for some people. Let us know if you are concerned about your ability to do the full 1.5 hour MRI, and we can discuss whether this study is right for you.
