# Scheduling MRI Scans at CAHBIR

Date: January 6, 2025 9:13 AM

- Get [iLab](https://rutgers.ilab.agilent.com/) access: this is where you schedule:
    
    iLab: [https://rutgers.ilab.agilent.com/](https://rutgers.ilab.agilent.com/) 
    
    1. log into ilab (registration link here: [https://rutgers.ilab.agilent.com/landing/196](https://rutgers.ilab.agilent.com/landing/196)) 
    2. Request access from your PI
    3. They allow
    4. Then CAHBIR allows
    5. Then you get access to project codes (Holmes Lab Project Code is Project 836892-800)
    6. Then you can schedule in ilab 

NOTE: make sure your irb allows a verbal phone screening  before participants arrive at CAHBIR. Pre-scan phone screenings are essential. Otherwise many participants may come to your sessions and not be able to be scanned, causing you to lose money and time.

- verbal phone scan: ask about medical implants (any surgeries), claustrophobia, and other general MRI-prohibitive things

- Editing Reservation Requests
    - Labs are now able to cancel a reservation in iLab after it has been approved. Please note that iLab will warn you of a fee even when the reservation is canceled outside of the 24-hour cancelation period. CAHBIR staff will refer to the timestamp provided at the time of cancelation to determine if a fee is warranted. Unfortunately, editing approved reservations is still NOT permitted. Alternatively, you may cancel the original reservation and reserve the correct date/time. Labs are no longer required to submit a request to [cahbir-support@rutgers.edu](mailto:cahbir-support@rutgers.edu) when canceling or editing approved reservations. Please reach out with any questions.
