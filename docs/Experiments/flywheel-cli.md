# Install Legacy Command Line Interface (CLI)

### Step 1: Download flywheel command line interface
The flywheel CLI is not able to be downloaded off a package manager like pip. Instead, you download it manually into your computer.

There is an existing instance in the Holmes Lab project space at `/projects/f_ah1491_1/analysis_tools/flywheel/linux_amd64/fw`

OR, you can download it somewhere locally by following the instructions on this tutorial: [Installing the Flywheel CLI](https://docs.flywheel.io/CLI/start/install/) Then, copy the filepath to where the flywheel .exe was downloaded into. The 

Now try linking to that flywheel instance in your terminal, like:
```
/projects/f_ah1491_1/analysis_tools/flywheel/linux_amd64/fw --version
```

If that returns a version number, you have it set up correctly. 

To use fw commands, you can either:

OPTION 1: This is already set up. You can call the full path to the shared copy of the file (`/projects/f_ah1491_1/analysis_tools/flywheel/linux_amd64/fw`) each time you want to run a command 

```bash
/projects/f_ah1491_1/analysis_tools/flywheel/linux_amd64/fw [COMMAND]
```

OPTION 2: move a copy of the fw file to your /home/netID/bin folder so you only have to say `fw` to reference the package

```bash
fw [COMMAND]
```

**How to set up Option 2:** 

Run this command in your terminal, replacing <netID> with your netID

```bash
export PATH="/projects/f_ah1491_1/analysis_tools/flywheel/linux_amd64:$PATH"
source ~/.bashrc
```

If you get a conda error, try running `conda deactivate` and then again `conda deactivate` until youâ€™re fully out of all condas and then try this again

You should be able to run

```bash
fw --help
```

If it returns this, youâ€™ve got it setup!

```bash
usage: fw [-h]  ...

Flywheel command-line interface

options:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit

Available commands:
  
    login     Login to a Flywheel instance
    logout    Delete your saved API key
    status    See your current login status
    version   Print CLI version
    cp        Copy a local file to a remote location, or vice-a-versa
    ls        Show remote files
    download  Download a remote file or container
    upload    Upload a local file to a Flywheel container
    export    Export data from Flywheel
    job       [DEPRECATED] Start or manage server jobs
    sync      Sync files from Flywheel to storage
    ingest    Ingest data
    deid      Test your de-identification template or generate a sample template

```

### Step 2: Generate an API key on Flywheel

1. Go to [https://cahbir-flywheel.rutgers.edu/#/projects](https://cahbir-flywheel.rutgers.edu/#/projects)
2. Click on your profile picture in the top right > â€˜Profileâ€™
3. Scroll down to â€˜Flywheel Accessâ€™ and click â€˜+ Generate API Keyâ€™
4. Copy API key and save in safe space

### Step 3: Add your API key to your .bash_aliases file

1. Log into Amarel on the terminal with ssh
2. enter `nano ~/.bash_aliases`
3. enter ``alias fwlogin='/path/to/fw login cahbir-flywheel.rutgers.edu:<your_API_key>'` 
  For example, if using the Holmes Lab fw instance: `alias fwlogin='/projects/f_ah1491_1/analysis_tools/flywheel/linux_amd64/fw login cahbir-flywheel.rutgers.edu:<your_API_key>`
4. press control+X â†’ â€˜Yâ€™ â†’ â€˜Enterâ€™ to save and exit 
5. enter `source ~/.bashrc`` to update

ðŸš¨ Note: when your API key expires, make a new one and update it in your bash_aliases through this process


### Step 4: login to CLI with API Key on Flywheel:

1. If you did step 3, type `fwlogin'`
  -> This should return `You are now logged in as <Your Name>!`

2. If you did not do step 3, copy and paste this formula into your command line
```bash
#Formula: <filepath to fw> login <yourAPIKey>
#ex: 
/path/to/fw  login cahbir-flywheel.rutgers.edu:<your_API_key> 
```

-> When it logs in, it will say `You are now logged in as: <Your Name>!`



## Usage

To view the available list of commands, run `fw -h` (^^pasted above). More information about each command can found in the *Command References* documentation folder.

*Getting Help*

With any command, you can add -h or --help to get more information. For example, with the `ls` command we'll see in the following section:

```bash
usage: fw ls [-h] [--config-file CONFIG_FILE | --no-config] [-y] [--ca-certs CA_CERTS] [--timezone TIMEZONE] [--debug | --quiet]
             [--ids] [-a]
             [path]
positional arguments:
  path                  The path to list subfolders and files
options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --config-file CONFIG_FILE, -C CONFIG_FILE
                        Specify configuration options via config file
  --no-config           Do NOT load the default configuration file
  -y, --yes             Assume the answer is yes to all prompts
  --ca-certs CA_CERTS   The file to use for SSL Certificate Validation
  --timezone TIMEZONE   Set the effective local timezone for imports
  --debug               Turn on debug logging
  --quiet               Squelch log messages to the console
  --ids                 Display database identifiers
  -a, --all             Show all

```

# Downloading Data: The `fw download` Command

Sessions, acquisitions, and files can be downloaded individually using the `fw download` command.

## Usage

```bash
fw download [-h] [--config-file CONFIG_FILE | --no-config] [-y] 
[--ca-certs CA_CERTS] [--timezone TIMEZONE] [--debug | --quiet][-o [OUTPUT]] [-p PREFIX] [-i INCLUDE] [-e EXCLUDE] <source-path>
```

### Arguments

| Argument | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `source-path` | REQUIRED: The location of the file on your Flywheel instance. For example [fw://group/project/subject/acquisition/attachments] |
| `-i FILE_TYPE`, `--include FILE_TYPE` | Download only files with the specified types.* |
| `-e FILE_TYPE`, `--exclude FILE_TYPE` | Ignore files with the specified types.* |
| `-o`, `--output file name` | Name of the folder where the data is downloaded |

`fw download --help`

- [Learn more about file types in Flywheel](https://docs.flywheel.io/user/upload/user_file_types_in_flywheel/)


## Example: Downloading Acquisition Files

Below is an example of how to download a particular subject:

### Find the files
1. Find which group you need files from. You can return all the "groups" you're a part of (and your permissions) by running run `fw ls`. The Holmes Lab "group" in flywheel is `022`, so it may say:

  $ `fw ls`
  Output: `rw   022`
    
2. Next, figure out what "project" they're in. Running `fw ls 022` will return all the projects in the Holmes Lab group
```bash
[netID@amarel ~]$ fw ls 022
rw   Napls       
rw   PCX         
rw   ConteCenter 
```
3. See what data is availabe in the project you're interested in. For example
```bash
[kj537@amarel2 ~]$ fw ls 022/Napls
rw                          analyses/bids-pre-curate 05/03/2025 17:41:29 
rw                          analyses/curate-bids 05/03/2025 17:47:15     
rw     5B May 03 2025 22:47 files/README.txt                             
rw   200B May 03 2025 22:47 files/dataset_description.json               
rw  1.1KB May 03 2025 22:47 files/participants.txt                       
rw                          sub-NDARZN877YYQ                             
rw                          sub-NDARZP892XY9                             
rw                          sub-NDARZW884MZC          
```
4. You can investigate the contents of subjects (acquisition files) or specific analyses. For example

```bash
[kj537@amarel2 ~]$ fw ls "022/ConteCenter/PCR2Pilot/001/analyses/bids-fmriprep 03/14/2025 11:22:35"
files/bids_tree.html
files/bids-fmriprep_001_67d449d202be158786fab2d3.zip
files/fmriprep_log.txt
files/sub-PCR2Pilot.html.zip
```


### Download the files

To download files, run `fw download /path/to/files`. 

```bash
[kj537@amarel2 ~]:~ AvaAnderson$ fw download "022/ConteCenter/PCR2Pilot/001/analyses/bids-fmriprep 03/14/2025 11:22:35"
This download will be about 218 KB comprising 4 files.
Continue? (yes/no): yes
Wrote 218 MB to 2025 11:22:35.tar
```

# Downloading BIDS Files: The `fw export bids` Command

To download the BIDS versions of files (ie the output of the BIDS Curation gear), you don't use the `fw download` on the BIDS Curation analysis. That will just download the acquisitions.tsv and other tsvs which were the outputs of that gear. To download the files in BIDS format, use the `fw export bids` command.

The formula is:
`fw export bids -p "<project>" -g "<group>" /path/to/destination/folder`

For the Holmes Lab: 
group = 022
project = Conte, PCX, Napls, ...

So a download command may look like: 
`fw export bids -p "Conte" -g "022" ~/flywheel_download`

You can also download specific subjects, using the --subject flag. For example:
`fw export bids -p "Conte" --subject PCR2Pilot -g "022" ~/flywheel_download`



# Beta Command Line Interface (CLI)

<aside>
âš™

Prerequisites: The install script requires `bash`, `curl`, `grep`, `tar`, and `shasum` (or `sha256sum`) in order to download, extract, and verify the CLI.

</aside>

# 1 -- SSH into Amarel command line

```bash
ssh netID@amarel.rutgers.edu
```

# 2 -- Download prerequisites 

```bash
# latest stable version
curl https://storage.googleapis.com/flywheel-dist/fw-cli/stable/install.sh | sh
```

By default, `fw-beta` will be extracted under `~/.fw` with all of its dependencies. The installation folder can be customized using the envvar `FW_CLI_INSTALL_DIR`.

Shell profiles are automatically updated to include `fw-beta` on the `PATH` for bash and zsh using `~/.bash_profile` and `~/.zshenv` respectively.

# 3 â€” Activate new bash profile

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

# 4 â€” Use CLI `export`

### `export`

Export data from a Flywheel project to an external storage.

```bash
