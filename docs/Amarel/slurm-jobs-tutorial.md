- [Rutgers Slurm Job / Batch User Guide](https://sites.google.com/view/cluster-user-guide#h.p4379j6lgjuh)


## Quick Tutorial:

```bash
sbatch <filename>.sh #send job
sacct #see your current jobs
sacct -e #see all the variables you can specify to see about your jobs
acct --format=JobId,JobName%50,Partition%15,State,Elapsed,ExitCode,Start,End --starttime=2025-04-01T22:43:21 #example of vars
watch -n 1 squeue -u <netID> #watch your live currently running jobs
     # control + C to exit 'watch'
```

1. export my script as a NAME.sh file (make sure to add #!/bin/bash  at top)
2. Fill in this with your specs

```bash
#! /bin/bash
#SBATCH --partition=p_dz268_1
#SBATCH --job-name=<some job name>.sh 
#SBATCH --requeue
#SBATCH --nodes=1 
#SBATCH --ntasks=1
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1
#SBATCH --mem=2000
#SBATCH --time=*48:00:00*
#SBATCH --output=/path/to/folder/<some job name>.out 
#SBATCH --error=/path/to/folder/<some job name>.err

module purge

# Activate the holmesenv virtual environment to use installed packages
# if you need additional packages for your script, install them into /holmesenv/bin/activate
source ~/projects/community/holmesenv/bin/activate

eval "$(conda shell.bash hook)"  # Properly initialize Conda
conda activate /projects/community/holmesenv

bash /path/to/your/file/<filename>.sh    
#OR 
python3 /path/to/your/file/<filename>.py
```

1. then save that whole script as run_NAME.sh (even if the file running is python)
2. then do this to make both files executable
    
    ```bash
    chmod +x NAME.py
    chmod +x run_NAME.sh
    ```
    
3. then run

```bash
sbatch run_NAME.sh
```

### Downloads (in login nodes)

Run all internet downloads on the login node

- 5-7 simultaneous downloads on the login node
- has faster internet connection
- slurm has small internet bandwidth, login has more, but also slurm bandwidth will stop everyone else
- add an ampersand at the end of the download line so that it runs in the background
- and also configure your computer so that it stays active
    - To do this, follow this tutorial: [NoHup Avoid Broken Pipe Error](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/nohup-avoid-input-output-message)

Code Template:

Just out file

```bash
/path/to/my_script.sh 1>/path/to/my_script.out &
```

Out file and error file

```bash
/path/to/my_script.sh 1>/path/to/my_script.out 2>/path/to/my_script.err &

python /projects/f_ah1491_1/open_data/NAPLS3/docs/scripts/bidsconverter/batchscripts/napls_bidsconverter_bysubj_jun11_copy3.py 1>/projects/f_ah1491_1/open_data/NAPLS3/docs/scripts/bidsconverter/batchscripts/out/terminalpytest3.out 2>/projects/f_ah1491_1/open_data/NAPLS3/docs/scripts/bidsconverter/batchscripts/err/terminalpytest3.out &
```

This will run your script in the background (&) and save out the terminal outputs into a file with the same name but a different extension (.out) and the error files into that name but (.err)

TIPS

- if anything weird comes up can do `scancel <job number>`
- `sacct -e` shows all the variables you could pull up for existing/past jobs
    - â€”state=failed, running, pending, completed
- try it with one subject, see time, multiply by subjects = time estimate

Troubleshooting:

- open error files via:
    
    ```bash
    cd /dir/where error file is/
    vi slurm.most.recent.err
    ```
    
    the top line will be the reasoning
    
- check permissions
- check everything is in the right folders

Common Shell Commands
`./` = current directory

`..` = parent directory

**`pwd`=** print working dir

**`cd /'dir'` =** change wd to specified dir

**`cd ..`** = change wd to parent directory

**`cd -`** = will go back to the directory you were last in 

**`ls`** = prints all the files in current dir

**`echo`** = returns whatever is after echo (or in quotes for stuff w spaces in it)

**`cat`** = display contents of files, concatenate (if multiple listed)

**`vim`** or `vi` = displays contents, like cat, but with additional features (scrolling, etc.)

`:q` gets you out of the vim viewer

**`cat â€˜fileâ€™` =** prints the contents of a file

**`xdg-open** â€˜fileâ€™` = 

**`~`** = home directory

**`<fn> -l`** = will give you more info on that function

**`ls -l`** = returns the permissions you have on the working directory
**`chmod +x <script.sh`>** = gives execute permissions to script.sh 

**`chmod ugo+rwx <script.sh`>** = change your permissions in a folder to read-write-execute 

**`mv /dir` =** moves a file

**`mkdir`** = make a new directory

**`rm`** = remove file (theres no undo)

**`cp`** 
`rsync [options] <source_file> <destination_directory>` = copy files; [options]: These are optional flags that modify the behavior of `rsync`. Some common options include `-a` (archive mode, preserves permissions and other attributes), `-v` (verbose output), `-r` (recursively copy directories), and `-u` (update only, skip files that are newer in the destination).

- rsync is recommended for larger files

**`>`** = specifies where you want the output of that command to be saved/to go

**`x | y`** = makes the *output* of x the *input* of 

**`sudo`** = runs the next command as the Root / Super User (canâ€™t run multiple commands w/o shell) 

- `sudo su` = run root as shell
- dangerous

**`tee`** = takes its input, and writes it to a (specific?) file, and prints it out

**`tail`** = print __ of the last output

**`tail -n1`** = print the last 1 line of the last output

**`./script.sh`** = will run script.sh in current directory

**`python script.py`** = run script.py in python
