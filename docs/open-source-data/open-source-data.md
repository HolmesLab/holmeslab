# Online Data Repositories and Databases
## [OpenNEURO](https://openneuro.org/)
This is where some Holmes Lab data repositories are stored, including the [Transdiagnostic Connectome Project](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds005237/versions/1.0.1).
* To upload data to OpenNeuro, data needs to be in BIDS format.

## [National Data Archive](https://nda.nih.gov/)
This is where big datasets like the Human Connectomes Project (and all it's substudies), ABCD, BANDA, NAPLS, and other large consortium studies have their data. There are also many smaller datasets on here. It is maintained by the United States government. 
This is where data from the Conte Latent Cause Inference project goes.
* To upload data to the NDA, there are many requirements for documentation and formatting. 
* To access data from NDA, follow [this tutorial](./data-from-nda).

## [Synapse.org](https://www.synapse.org/)
This is another site which hosts much open-source data, including neuroimaging data. 

## [Allen Brain Atlas](https://portal.brain-map.org/) 
Allen Brain Atlas hosts much brain-related open-source data. Allen focuses on genetic data and mapping neuron-level circuitry. 

## [UK Biobank](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/)
UK biobank is a large neuroimaging dataset.

# Data Resource Sites: Neuroimaging
These are sites which are relevant to datasets, but aren't directly data hosting sites. They contain tutorials, visualization software, analysis tools, dataset searches, and other useful resources. 

[Neurovault](https://neurovault.org/)
- A public repository of unthresholded statistical maps, parcellations, and atlases of the brain.
- searchable & conglomerated by associated keywords (from studies), areas, and coordinates

[NeuroImaging PREProcessing toolS (NiPreps)](https://www.nipreps.org/)
- Explanations of collection of industry-standard end-to-end neuroimaging processes, including fMRIPreps, Nibabel, Nilearn and BIDS

[NeuroStars](https://neurostars.org/)
- A question and answer forum for neuroscience researchers, infrastructure providers and software developers.

[NeuroImaging Tools and Resource Collaboratory](https://www.nitrc.org/) (NITRC)
- Free web-based resource that offers comprehensive information on an ever expanding scope of neuroinformatics software and data

[OpenNEURO](https://openneuro.org/)
- A free and open platform for validating and sharing BIDS-compliant [MRI](https://openneuro.org/search/modality/mri), [PET](https://openneuro.org/search/modality/pet), [MEG](https://openneuro.org/search/modality/meg), [EEG](https://openneuro.org/search/modality/eeg), and [iEEG](https://openneuro.org/search/modality/ieeg) data

[Cognitive Atlas](http://www.cognitiveatlas.org/)
- A collaborative knowledge base characterizing the state of current thought in Cognitive Science.

[Brain Imaging Data Structure](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/)
- Hosts the industry-standard file-organizing structure for neuroimaging data

[Brain Chart](https://brainchart.shinyapps.io/brainchart/) 

[Brainlife.io](https://brainlife.io/about/) 

[The Virtual Brain](https://www.thevirtualbrain.org/tvb/zwei)
