Transportation **Keep only the relevant transportation information and delete the other options

UBER
From our last conversation, you chose to have us send an uber to INSERT ADDRESS. Please let me know If anything has changed! Otherwise I will schedule the uber with the 'add rider" option, and I'll enter in your number. This way the alerts about the driver details and driver arrival time will be texted to you, and you can also contact the driver if you need to. I'll send it 15minutes before your MRI session time.

DRIVING
From our conversation, you chose to drive yourself. Let us know if that changes! Here is the link to the location of the center: https://go.rutgers.edu/map-to-CAHBIR. 
Please use this link + Google Maps to navigate to the center, as any other maps app will take you to the back of our center.
If you have to use another maps app, you can paste these coordinates into the app: 40.527176, -74.468806

NJTRANSIT + UBER
From our last conversation, you chose to take NJ transit to New Brunswick Train Station, where I’ll send an uber to pick you up at around 9:15 (let me know when your train is scheduled to arrive, I’m flexible and could have the uber pick you up/start the session a bit earlier/later). Please let me know If anything has changed! 

I will schedule the uber with the 'add rider" option, and I'll enter in your number. This way the alerts about the driver details and driver arrival time will be texted to you, and you can also contact the driver if you need to.

This link has additional MRI information- what an MRI is and what happens during an MRI procedure. If you’ve never had an MRI before, or you are curious about the procedure, please read it over.
