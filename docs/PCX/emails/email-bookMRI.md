Hi <insert name>,

My name is Kaley and I‚Äôm the coordinator for the MRI session of the Rutgers study. Thank you for participating in our study. To book the MRI session, please choose a slot here! 
Book Slot:  <insert notion calendar scheduling link>    
        

Additionally, please fill out this MRI screener form as soon as possible! We need this in order to confirm booking of the MRI scan.
Required MRI Screener Form: <insert CAHBIR MRI screener form>

Finally, please let me know which transportation option you prefer: 
The session will be at the Center for Advanced Human Brain Imaging Research (661 Hoes Ln W, Piscataway, NJ)
Option #1: We send you an uber to pick you up and drop you off (must be less than $55 one-way)
Option #2: You take public transportation to the New Brunswick or other train station, we send an uber to get you from there, less than $55 one-way
Option #3: You drive yourself to Center for Advanced Human Brain Imaging Research (parking lot: 195 Bevier Rd, Piscataway, NJ 08854)

(If you choose Option #2:  I'll do the 'add rider" option, and I'll enter in your number. This way the alerts about the driver details and driver arrival time will be texted to you, and you can also contact the driver if you need to. I'll send it 15minutes before your MRI session time. I'll also reimburse you for your train ticket, however it will take about 2 weeks for the reimbursement to process. I'll ask you for how much your train ticket was when we're at the session.)

Reimbursement, and payment, will come in the form of Visa e-gift cards, which we'll email to you:

The session is 3h15min long, and you‚Äôll be paid $60. (+$25 if you complete another 1hr survey at home). 

Options for Visa e-gift cards use:
-> üì≤ Add the card to your Google or Apple wallet. Then you can use it with Tap-To-Pay (select ‚ÄúCredit‚Äù when using Tap-To-Pay)
-> üßë‚Äçüíª You can also use this card number directly to purchase anything online, just as you would with any debit or credit card (but you must add it to your google or apple wallet if you need to enter a zip code or billing address when purchasing ‚Äî follow steps below to add to your wallet)
-> You can also press ‚ÄúGet a Plastic Card‚Äù and follow the prompts to have a plastic gift card sent to an address, which can be used to purchase at any store in person

If you want to know more about the MRI procedures feel free to ask me any questions, and read through this MRI Information page: https://holmeslab.github.io/holmeslab/docs/PCX/interview-session/MRI_Information.pdf 

Thank you, 
Kaley
