Dear INSERT NAME,  
** INSERT MONTH  
** INSERT PAYMENT  
**INSERT MINDLAMP USER   
**INSERT MINDLAMP PASSWORD  

Thank you for participating in the MindLAMP portion of the study!  
 
Over the month of XXX, you have completed: XX Survey Days, which results in $XX.  

Payment will be sent to you in the next 2 weeks (each monthly payment must be submitted for processing to our university after the month ends, which is why it takes so long). Payment will come to your email, just like the session payments did.  

If you continue, you’re on track to make $XX of the possible $35, next month.  

Let me know if you have any questions!  
-Kaley

This is the payment schedule, based on the amount of days you complete surveys. (Completing 15 surveys in the same day only = 1 day of payment):  
	• $5 for 5-9 surveys completed during the month  
	• $10 for 10-14 surveys completed during the month   
	• $15 for 15-19 surveys completed during the month  
	• $30 for 20-24 surveys completed during the month  
	• $35 for 25+ surveys completed during the month  
 

The payments are Visa gift cards, which means they can be used just like a debit card. They can be added to your apple wallet/google wallet to be used with tap-to-pay, and can also be used for any payment online.
