Thank you for booking an MRI session! Your session has been confirmed  for ENTER DATE. In this email you will find more information about your upcoming MRI visit.  

This email will also be sent 2 days prior to your visit, for confirmation.  

Reminders for this visit: 
The visit begins at ENTER DATE with check-in at the Center for Advanced Human Brain Imaging Rutgers University in Piscataway, NJ. We will go over the consent form and  you will fill out some questionnaires for about 30mins. The MRI will last approximately 1.5 hours, followed by a short computer task. This visit will be approximately 3h 15mins.

What to Wear (**please read!**): 
Wear comfortable clothing, remove ALL piercings or hair extensions if you have any. No magnetic or sparkley nailpolish. No color color/tinted/non-normal contact lenses. Any removable items, including hearing aids, insulin patches or dentures will have to be removed prior to scanning. There will be a locker to put your personal belongings. If you wear a wig, we will ask you to remove it, but we will have bouffant caps available to wear. There can be not metal in the MRI, but pants with metal zippers/buttons are fine. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns about what to wear for the MRI. If you wear glasses, please wear contacts or be aware of your prescription so we can fit you for MRI safe glasses. 


Transportation CHANGE UBER/DRIVING
From our last conversation, you chose to have us send an uber to INSERT ADDRESS. Please let me know If anything has changed! Otherwise I will schedule the uber with the 'add rider" option, and I'll enter in your number. This way the alerts about the driver details and driver arrival time will be texted to you, and you can also contact the driver if you need to. I'll send it 15minutes before your MRI session time.
