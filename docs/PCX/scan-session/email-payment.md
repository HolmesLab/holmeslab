Dear   ,

Thank you so much for attending the MRI session at the Holmes Lab! We really appreciate your time.  

Here are the payment details from your scan and self-report battery today ($60). We’ll send you another $30 once you finish the supplemental survey. Additionally, we’ll send payments based on how many surveys you complete each month. These will come the second week of the month for the previous month. 

The payments are Visa gift cards, which means they can be used just like a debit card. They can be added to your apple wallet/google wallet to be used with tap-to-pay, and can also be used for any payment online. 


INSTRUCTIONS: 
Steps to Access Your $60 Visa eCard:
