**Passive Data Collection**

First, passive data is collected automatically in the background while you go about your day. This includes things like how much you move (using your phone’s motion sensors), general location data (GPS), and phone usage patterns like when your screen is on or off. It also includes anonymized information about nearby Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connections, as well as call and text activity logs, which only track things like number of texts sent and length of message, but we **never** record the content of your calls or messages, and we don’t track who you’re talking to. The purpose is just to get a general idea of your social activity levels, never the specifics.

This will give us an idea of things like your activity during the day, how much you're sleeping, how much you're moving, how much exercise you're doing.

**Active Data Collection**

Next, there’s active data collection. This is where you’ll get 1-2 short surveys per day sent to your phone. These will ask things like how you’re feeling, what you’ve been up to, or how you slept. They’re super quick—usually around two minutes, never more than five. 

**Timeline**
This will run for a maximum of **six months**, but if you would like to leave the study at any time during that period, you can always **uninstall the app and it will stop collecting data.**

**Data & Privacy?**
We take your privacy very seriously. Your data is encrypted, stored securely, and never linked to your name—only to a coded identifier. We also make sure all transfers are encrypted, and your information is only accessible to trained researchers. If you ever decide to stop participating, you can uninstall the app and let us know, and we’ll delete your data from our systems (though it may take a couple of months to fully remove all backups). Also, the app only uploads data when you’re connected to Wi-Fi, so it won’t use up your phone’s data plan."

**Compensation**

Here’s how you’ll be compensated for your time. Each month, you’ll be paid based on the number of survey DAYS you complete:

- Complete 5-9 survey days = You’ll earn $5.
- Complete 10-14 =  $10.
- Complete 15-19 = $15.
- Complete 20-24 =  $30.
- Complete 25 or more? = $35

Payment schedule is the end of each month. So for example on the 30th of this month I'll see how many surveys you did this month (even if you in the middle of this month) and pay you based on that.

You can participate for up to six months, starting after your scan. The more surveys you complete, the higher your compensation—it’s that simple! Note that surveys are daily—if you complete 20 surveys in 1 day trying to get $30, it won’t count. You must complete the surveys on separate days.

Do you have any questions?
