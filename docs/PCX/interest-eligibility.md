INSTRUCTIONS: <font color="blue">After the SCID or on a cold call, ask the participant the below MRI Eligibility questions before scheduling them for Clinical Interview Session.</font>

When sending the confirmation for Clinical Interview Session, you can also send the [MRI screener form](https://rutgers.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6M462seOVvuYD5k). 

*They do NOT have to have completed it, and it is NOT CCNP’s responsibility to confirm they have completed the form/are eligible based on the form. Only responsible for asking the below questions, which will exclude 99% of ineligible people*. 

Holmes Lab will monitor the MRI screener form and let you know if there’s anyone with a red flag, but if they haven’t completed it before session 1, once they do session one and get added to the linking sheet, Holmes Lab will contact them to fill it out.

## SCRIPT: 

We wanted to see if you're interested in an additional study by a lab working with CCNP:
It has two parts:
1. A 1-2 hour session, online or in person, doing surveys and interview questions. You'd be paid $20/hour over Zelle, Venmo or CashApp
2. A 3h15min session, in person, doing a 90-minute brain MRI scan and 30 mins of survey questions. You'd be paid $60 in a VISA gift card. 
3. An optional 1hr survey at home for $25 and an optional phone-tracking and daily survey part where you could make $35/month for up to 6 months,

### MRI Eligibility Overview:**
Before scheduling, I need to ask a few quick safety and study questions about the MRI— we’ll also have you fill out an in-depth screener form before the scan, but these are quick ones to see if you’re likely eligible:

1. Do you have any of the following: pacemaker, aneurysm clip, neural stimulators, cochlear implants, artificial cardiac valves? Or any other metal implant*? (*If they have a different implant, still schedule them)
2. Do you have any piercings that you can't remove?
3. Do you have any metal fragments in the eyes? Or any metal shards/bullets embedded?
4. Are you currently, or might you be in the next few months, pregnant?
5. Are you claustrophobic? Would you be able to be in the MRI for 90 minutes?
6. Might you be available for a 4hr block during Mon-Fri for a scan? (3hr scan session + time for transportation there and back)
7. Are you OK with payment with a VISA gift card? (Not cash/cashapp)

-> <font color="red">If "Yes" to any, don't schedule.</font> 
Note: If they have a metal implant/surgery other than the ones listed, they may still be eligible, so still schedule, and let Holmes Lab know so they can check the MRI screener.
