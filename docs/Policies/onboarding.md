## General Onboarding Tasks
This is an overview/example of onboarding tasks for new members of the lab. This may be lab managers, PhD students or new undergrad RAs. Some of it is administrative, other is for lab content. This 



### Technical onboarding
- Join Holmes slack and possibly CAHBIR slack
- Broadly overview our lab wiki https://holmeslab.github.io/holmeslab/
- Get swipe access for CAHBIR building -- have the lab manager email `cahbir-support#rutgers.edu` 
- Request access to our lab partition on Amarel (see here)
Copy Avram, Carrisa, and Kaley on any emails to OARC
PI name = Avram Holmes; Campus = Piscataway; Department = Center for Advanced Human Brain Imaging Research
CITI certificates (in Admin section of lab wiki) 
And send certs to Kaley
Get access to NIMH data archive (NDA)
Note from Carrisa: request that Kaley add you to our NDA access group; her and Avram manage and approve this
Add relevant lab calendars to your google calendar (see here)
Sign up for relevant listservs (see Email lists section below the shared calendars section from link above)
Set up a reference/citation/paper manager if you don’t have one already. Free (or covered by RU) options = EndNote, Zotero. Other = Paperpile. All will have browser extensions.
Note from Carrisa: you should be able to access most journals’ papers through campus wifi or VPN when off campus. If you are unfamiliar with any part of that process (VPN, how to access PR journals/papers, etc.), let me know in our next meeting and I’ll demonstrate
Highly recommended: installing google scholar chrome extension

Training
Go through Amarel Computing section on lab wiki in detail 
Go through Lab Policies section on lab wiki in detail 
Set up time for regulatory training for fMRI scanner 
See CAHBIR MRI Suite section under Running Experiments in lab wiki (also see here)
Go through Open Source Data section on lab wiki in detail, with special focus on NDA section 
See lab wiki Resources section for materials on coding, grant writing, etc.; decide what’s relevant for you
Go through initial literature review papers recommended below
Note from Carrisa: recommend reading each paper 1-3 times and taking notes, including questions to talk with me about. If a particular concept/method is either confusing or otherwise interesting to you, I recommend going to the reference(s) cited in the paper you’re reading, and add that paper to your TBR list as well. These “secondary” reads can be less extensive of course (e.g., maybe just reading abstract or results), or fully read through with notes etc. as well - totally tailored to you given your level of interest, gaps in understanding you may have, etc.

Scheduling / other 
Set up a schedule with Carrisa for work
Note from Carrisa: this is flexible from my POV, but having a routine will likely be beneficial when classes start up again 
Related to a, discuss with Carrisa a strategy for work that suits you, including how to log the work you’ve done (i.e., “lab notebook”), extent of sharing, how to log questions for meetings, etc. etc.
If you’d like to get experience with recruitment and running experiments with participants in the scanner, schedule a meeting with Kaley and Carrisa to set expectations, scheduling, preparation/training, etc. 
Podcast recommendation from Kaley: “A great intro to basic network neuroscience concepts is this podcast episode: The Brain as a Complex System (I’m not sure your level of familiarity, but if not familiar, this gives a great intro into what people mean when they say ’network’, ’node’, etc etc):”
