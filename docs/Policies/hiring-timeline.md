### Pre-placement Health Exam Process
10. Call [EOHSI RBHS Employee Health Services](https://eohsi.rutgers.edu/clinic2021/) at 848-445-0123 or clinic@eohsi.rutgers.edu and schedule a time to go **in person to New Brunswick, NJ*** for a 'pre placement exam' in person.
    Address: 170 Frelinghuysen Road, Piscataway, New Jersey 08854
    1. **If you will be interacting with patients, you will need to make TWO times.** You be required to do a Tuberculosis exposure test, which means you will have to **return to the EOHSI building in ~48 hours to get your test read.** This means you have to schedule your test in a way where you **are available to return ~48 hours later** to Rutgers- New Brunswick in person to get the test read
    2. Schedule physical: They’ve got a lot of opening for this, but you have to find a time you can go in person to New Brunswick either 1 day going in or 2 days spaced 48hrs apart, ie Monday & Wednesday
    **If you are not by New Brunswick, you can schedule with a local clinic, but you'll have to talk to the EOHSI to coordinate doing this at a local clinic where you are!** 

    When you schedule a pre-placement exam, bring:
    - A completed Employee Health Questionnaire. The questionnaire will be given to
    you by Human Resources.
    - A record of your vaccinations (*unless you've already put them in the vaccine portal mentioned above):
        - COVID 19*
        - Measles*
        - Rubella*
        - Varicella*
        - Hepatitis B* if drawing blood or doing procedures that may result in
        bloodborne pathogen exposure
        - Flu* (during flu season either a record of vaccine or declination from)
    - Your job/position description included your unit, institute, or school, and
    department
    - A record of a recent TB skin test (if performed in the last year)*
        - If missing vaccinations or a recent TB skin test, they will be provided.
        
    Please call the clinic at 848-445-0123 to make an appointment for a pre-placement exam. If they
    are unable to answer the phone, please leave a message and they will return your call.
    The clinic hours are 8AM to 4PM. The last patient is scheduled at 3PM
    
    **AT THE APPOINTMENT:** They'll ask you what your interaction will be with participants/people. Your maximum interaction will be "interacting with people who come into our center to do studies." You will not be going into patient wings, into hospitals or into outpatient centers for recruitment or other study activities. 

11. After your pre-placement exam (or, after your TB-exposure test has been read 48hrs after your physical, if you interact with patients), the EOHSI will send HR notification that you've received medical clearance, and should send you an email the next day about when you'd like your start date to be.
    1. Time this takes: 1-3 business days

### Start Date & New Employee Orientation
12. Talk to Avram about a start date
13. Propose a start date to HR
    1. Should be a Monday so you can go to a New Employee Orientation
    2. Should be a few days to a week from the date you send the email requesting the start date, so you have time to do the pre-Orientation tasks and get your NetID
14. They will respond with whether that start date is accepted (they have to check with the department of Psychiatry, but it shouldn't take more than a day)
    1. Time this takes: 1 business day
15. Once it is confirmed, **you will receive an email like this** in your inbox:
<details markdown="block">
<summary>Email you'll receive (click me!)</summary>
    Hi [name],
    
    I received confirmation that your start date will be [START DATE].  Attached, please find your final offer letter for review and signature.  Please scan/e-mail back to me as soon as possible (all pages in PDF document/attachment).  Additionally, I’ve attached a Getting Started memo which provides you with some information for your first day/week.  Once your new hire paperwork has been processed into our HR system, you will receive an e-mail sent to your personal e-mail address to activate your NetID.  You will first need to activate your NetID in order to do anything else, such as, obtain an employee ID card, sign up for parking, and access your employee portal to complete your W-4 forms and sign up for direct deposit.  Please note, your employee portal will not be available to access until on or after your start date.  Please see attached for more detail on all of this information.  
    
    I am going to sign you up to attend HR orientation for [DATE], at the Administrative Services Building II – 57 Route 1, New Brunswick, NJ from 9 am-12 pm.  
    **Please see the attached instructions for the I9. You do not need to use a notary if not easily acceptable. You can use a co-worker, family member, etc.**. 
    You are required to complete an I-9/E-Verify process before your start date. Due to the current circumstances regarding COVID-19, we are no longer conducting in-person meetings for the I-9 process. At this time we are allowing a remote hire, which allows a new employee to remotely complete Section I of their I-9 and have a local outside agent complete Section II on Rutgers’ behalf with the employee in person. I attached to this email, the appropriate legal documents to use for this process.  
    The employee could use their current employer’s local HR Department, Notary Public, or Attorney.  They must be trustworthy, as they will be representing the University in the I-9 process. *Under the circumstances raised by COVID-19, if no other option is available, DHS (Department of Homeland Security) will consider a family or household member to act as a remote agent. You are liable for any violations in connection with the form or the verification process, including any violation of the employer sanctions laws committed by the person designated to act your behalf. If no agent can be found, contact UHR.*. 
    Once you have found a remote agent to assist you, I will need you to provide the following:  
    Remote Agent’s
    - Full Name
    - Work Address [physical address, do not use a P.O. Box]
    - Job Title / Department (you can specify if it is a family member.)
    - Telephone Number
    - E-mail 
    
    Next Steps:
    UHR will use provided information to send out a Guardian System e-mail to the new employee to complete Section I electronically and to the Remote Agent to complete Section II electronically with the employee in person with their original documents.
    New Employee completes Section I of I-9 Form electronically using their remote e-mail link. Review the List of Acceptable documents.
    New Employee goes to Remote Agent in person with original documents and agent completes Section II using their remote e-mail link. If you are using a US Passport or any item from column A, the system may alert you to scan and attach the document after completing section II (If you do not own a scanner, I suggest using documents from column B and C).
    New Employee alerts their Department I-9 Preparer/Hiring Manager to complete the rest of the I-9 process.
    Thanks,
    Mindy

- You'll both sign and submit the I9 information

    1. This will be on the closest MONDAY to your start date

## Tasks before New Employee Orientation
1. Let the lab (lab manager or PI [holmes@rutgers.edu](mailto:avram.holmes@rutgers.edu)) know when your New Employee Orientation is scheduled for. If you’re planning on driving, send your car information (make, model, year, license plate) so that the department can issue you a guest parking permit.
    1. If you’re planning on taking public transport, check out [Transit and Transportation on Rutgers NB Campus](https://rutgers.box.com/s/oubs9ulm23qwxuy85ahbe2yvcz7fn46c) document
2. Make sure to upload a photo for your ID to [online photo submission website](https://ipo.rutgers.edu/publicsafety/iam/online-photo-submission)then you will be given your photo ID at orientation
3. Look over benefits information before orientation, so you can ask any questions then
    1. [Benefits for Full-Time Employees](https://uhr.rutgers.edu/benefits/enrolling-benefits-full-time-employees)
4. New employees should complete section I of the I-9 by the end of their first day of employment. A list of acceptable documents needed for the I-9 can be found [here](https://uhr.rutgers.edu/docs/acceptable-documents).
5. You should also receive a link in your email to activate your NetID. If you don't you can still try to activate your netID on this link:  [Rutgers NetID](http://netid.rutgers.edu/)
        1. Make sure your password is secure but also memorizable- you have to enter it a LOT
        2. Send your netID to the lab manager

Time this takes: I would give 2 business days minimum for this, including getting and activating NetID and getting parking pass from Holmes Lab.
