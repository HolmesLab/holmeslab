# [Psychiatric Connectomics]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/Projects/PCX/study-overview)

### Aims

Objective:  **Establish connectome signatures, or ‚Äúfingerprints‚Äù, that co-vary with cognition, negative valence systems, and social functions in healthy and clinical samples, dissecting their associated genetic and cellular bases.**

**Questions to address:**
1) To what extent can brain function predict symptom profiles (cognition, negative valence, and social functions) across transdiagnostic cohorts, revealing the presence of clinical subgroups 

2) Can a predictive modeling approach establish network profiles that precede longitudinal change

3) Do cell type profiles recapitulate functional network organization in the general
population

4) Do these cellular associates of network function reveal genomic signatures that are co-heritable with psychiatric illness risk
