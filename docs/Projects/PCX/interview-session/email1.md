Subject: Link to PCX Surveys 

Hi `Name`,
Thank you for filling out the consent forms, we’re excited to have you in our study.
Attached here are some links and information you’ll need for the second half of the session today. This involves filling out surveys about your behavior and experience. Please fill out all surveys to the best of your ability. If you do not wish to answer a question, you can always select “Do not wish to answer.” These surveys should take approximately 1 hour.
While you’re taking the survey, a staff member will stay on zoom, but off camera and muted. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them, they will be able to hear you! Additionally, if you would like to take a 5-10 minute break, please feel free to do so, just let the staff member know.
