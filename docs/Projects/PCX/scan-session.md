## **SECTION 1: Consent**

Welcome to imaging session of our study!

Before we start, I want to ask, did you drive yourself today? If so, did you have to pay any tolls or parking fees? [Record amounts of any fees, +$5 offset for gas costs, into subject log]

Just to let you know, today I’ll be reading to you from a script, so we can make sure that all our participants are getting the same exact instructions. The first thing that we’ll do today is complete some paperwork. I’ll walk you through the consent form, which explains what the study is about and what you can expect. Feel free to ask questions at any point. If everything sounds good, then I’ll ask you to sign the form, and we’ll proceed with the experiment.

You are invited to participate in a research study on individual differences in how the brain functions. We hope that this data will allow us to better understand the bigger questions of how people vary in their behavior, and how those variations come about.

 I'll give you a brief overview of our procedures, and then you can read more specifics in the consent form. 

### **Protocol Overview**

First, we're going to give you a collection of surveys, which will take about an hour, asking you about your mood, emotions, history, those types of things.

 Then we'll go over the MRI screening form again just to make sure nothing has changed. 

After that, I'll take you through some of the tasks that we're going to be doing just on my computer here, so that you know what to expect when we get into the MRI room.

After that, we're going to walk down to the MRI room. I'm going to have you change into a scrub top, but you can keep your pants - anything from the waist down. You'll also take off your shoes before going into the scanner. 

The large, donut-shaped machine in the room down the hall is the MRI scanner, which uses a magnetic field (***not*** ionizing radiation) to take pictures of your brain. The MRI scanner is like a really old camera, so you have to stay really still because it takes pictures of your brain over time. And so if you move, then the pictures will be blurry.

During today’s study, we’ll run a few different scans -- during these scans, we’ll ask you to lie as still as possible. You will also play do some simple tasks that we’ll go over in just a second. You'll also watch some short films, and a planet earth episode. 

After the scan we're going to have a few more questionnaires which will take about 20 minutes.

We anticipate that today’s session will take no more than 4 hours. After you’re all done today, you’ll be compensated with $60.

If you want to stop at any time, just let me know. 

### **Additional Sessions**

 There are a few more parts to the study where you can get additional compensation:

1. One of those is a supplemental questionnaire where we'll send you a link to do about one more hour of questionnaires at home whenever it is convenient for you within the next 48 hours. If you finish those, you'll be sent an additional $30.
2. You can opt into a smartphone tracking research that we're doing. Basically it will be on your phone - it's an app. It won't take any of your cellular data but it will occasionally (every 3 minutes or so) check your GPS location and it will also check things like how fast you're moving using the accelerometer. It will also check how many times your phone turns on and off. 
This will give us an idea of things like your activity during the day, how much you're sleeping, how much you're moving, how much exercise you're doing.
The other part of the app is daily surveys where it will ask you about 10 questions every day. It'll pop up at 6pm but we can change that specific time. Then you'll answer questions about your mood and what you've been doing during the day.
The reason that we are interested in this is because it can give us an insight into how people's behavior affects their mood and how different people with different brain profiles may have different activity patterns or mood relationships that we can investigate with this long-term data.
For that portion of the study, you'll be paid based on how many survey days you complete. So if you complete 25 or more survey days, you'll be paid $35/month. If you complete 15 survey days, you'll be paid $20/month. The specifics are in the consent form. !! add!!
This will run for a maximum of six months, but if you would like to leave the study at any time during that period, you can always uninstall the app and it will stop collecting data. 

### **Data Privacy**

All of the data we collect in this study will be de-identified and stored securely in our lab, to protect your privacy. So instead of your name, all your data will be associated with a numerical ID, and the link to your name is stored on a protected, HIPAA-compliant document. So even when sharing with collaborators or other researchers, we'll never disclose your personal information.  The only people who could see things like your name, your birthday, your email, would be people who are directly staffed in this lab. 

Your participation in this study is totally voluntary, so you’re free to stop participating at any point; just let us know.

### **Signatures**

The first signature is allowing us to share your private health information, including identifiable information such as your name, with only the following groups listed.

- “medical history and medications”  which we collect only pertains to study data we collect - no additional medical records

The second part is where there's a signature is for allowing the main part of the study which is the surveys today, the supplemental survey, and the fMRI scan. 

The other boxes are for the two optional things:

1. The smartphone tracking part of the study
2.  Whether you are okay with your data being included in a mass de-identified upload to a data sharing site like the National Institute of Health, where there's a bunch of neuroscience studies where you can upload data and everyone can use it to further the field. This would be completely de-identified. They wouldn't be able to have any indicators of your face from the MRI scan. They wouldn't have your name. They wouldn't have your birthday. They wouldn't have the day that you go in for the study. They would only have the numerical code that isn't associated with any of your personal information. 

[*Participant must check off either Yes or No, then initial*]

Do you have any questions for me? [*Participant must print, sign, and date*] This signed copy is for us to keep, and on your way out we’ll give you a blank copy to keep for your records

## **SECTION 2: CAHBIR MRI screen, Surveys part 1**

Because the MRI scanner is essentially a giant magnet, I’m just going to verbally scan you again, need to make sure that you don’t have any metal inside you, or on your face or skin. Pant buttons are fine. So you don’t have any implants? pacemakers, or anything like that?

any injectables or patches on your skin like a glucose monitor?

Now we're going to go to the first selection of surveys, which will take about an hour. I'm going to set you up on this computer here, and then I'll leave the room. You can fill out the surveys, and I'll be right next door, so let me know if you have any questions or if you want any clarification on any of the questions. 

[Open [Self-Report Surveys](https://rutgers.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0UqGfGjgsl2nklU) (Qualtrics)]

First, I'll help with this first page. I'm going to tell you your de-identified study code that you'll enter in right here so that the survey isn't associated with your name. It's [PCRXXX]. 

All right, you click right here to begin the survey. I'm going to be right outside, so feel free to come outside if you have any questions. Other than that, just come and knock on the door when you’re finished!

[Leave room and go into room next door while they complete the survey]

## **SECTION 3: Tasks Instructions, MRI overview**

Great! Thank you for answering those surveys.

Now, I'm going to go over with you the tasks that we're going to do in the fMRI scanner so that you're familiar with them before we actually get into the scanner. Then, I'm also going to go over what exactly the MRI process will look like.

### **Flanker Task**

[[Flanker task training powerpoint](https://rutgers.box.com/s/fxwl23n2mdwpp7l784946we6cmu7po1x)]

[Slide 1] The first task is called the Flanker task. 

[Slide 2] In this task, there's going to be a cross that appears where you're just going to keep your eyes on it, and then arrows will appear. 

[Slide 3] The arrows will be pointing a certain direction (they'll be in the middle of the screen), and there will be one arrow missing in the very center of the four arrows. 

[Slide 4] Once that arrow comes on, that's the arrow you want to focus on. 

[Slide 5] What we're going to have you do is respond with the button box based on which direction the arrow is pointing. [Read slide]

[Slide 6] Now, it's a little confusing because you're going to have to use your pointer finger and your middle finger as your left and your right. Your pointer finger is going to be the left, so if the arrow is pointing left, you'll press that finger, and if the arrow is pointing right, you'll press the middle finger.

[Slide 7] so for example, if you see the first screen with arrows like this:

[Slide 8]  When the  middle arrow comes on - you're gonna press your index finger because it's going to the left. 

[Slide 9] Now you're seeing a first screen with arrows going to the right 

[Slide 10] And now the middle arrow is on, it’s also pointing to the right, and you're gonna press your middle finger because the middle arrow that comes on is pointing to the right as well.
[Slide 11] The task can get tricky when the arrows that are originally (you see) are not pointing the same way as the arrow in the middle is going to point. Here the arrows are all pointing to the right,

[Slide 12] but the middle arrow comes on, and it points to the left. So you're going to respond and press your index finger (on the top) for the left, not your middle finger for the right because the arrow in the middle is the one that you want to respond to. Does that make sense?

[Slide 13] now we're going to have you practice. So put your hand like you're holding a button box. I'm going to flip through the slides, and then you press with your finger as if you're holding a button box (which finger is the correct way), and I'll also show the correct answer so you can see if you got them right.

[*Click through slide 14-16]* Did you get it right?

[*Click through slide 17-19*] Did you get it right?

[*Click through slide 20-22*] Did you get it right?

[Slide 23] The aim is to respond both accurately and quickly. So you're only going to have a few seconds to respond. So you want to do it accurately and as quickly as possible.

### **Language Task**

[Open the training powerpoint in powerpoint, and play in presenter view: [Language Task Training Powerpoint](https://rutgers.box.com/s/fmifnrlyfphs74nlsc2hdf6gdpmb3e32)]

[Slide 1]: This is the other task, and the goal of this task is to map the regions of your brain that are active when you listen to and understand sentences as opposed to just hearing scrambled words.

[Slide 2]: This is the button box. You're only going to be responding with your index finger this time, so not to just the one finger for both button presses.

[Slide 3]: This is an example of an image. For every image, you're going to have two button presses. The image will only be on for one second, and then it'll go away. 

[Slide four] Then you'll see the fixation cross, and the audio will play. 

[Wait for audio to finish]

[Slide 5] Once the audio finishes, you’ll press on the button box 

[Slide 6] When you press on the button box, you'll see the fixation cross turn into a star like this

[Slide 7] Then

[Slide 8] the star will turn into a square. When you see that happen, press the button box again.

[Slide 9] After a bit, you’ll see another image

[Slide 10] The cross will appear and the audio will play

[Slide 11] When the audio ends, press on the button box 

[Slide 12] The cross will into a star 

[Slide 13] Then when you see it turn into a square

[Slide 8] Press the button box again.

Would you like to practice?

add more practice

say that there’s a fixation cross at the beginning

Okay, just pretend you’re holding the button box again. 

[Click through slides 16-19, and watch to make sure they’ve done it right.]

Great job!

## **SECTION 4: MRI Prep and Explanation**

 I'm going to explain what we're going to do when we head over to the MRI room, so that you can ask any questions now and not be caught off guard! 

Changing room

- You will be asked to change into a scrub top, and to take off your shoes, but you can keep your clothes on from the waist down (pants etc).
- You will be asked to remove jewelry, eyeglasses, hearing aids, hairpins, removable dental work or other objects that may interfere with the procedure.
- You will put all your items into a locked locker during the MRI
- You will be given MRI-safe prescription eyeglasses if you wear them

Have you ever had an MRI before? 

If YES, don’t go through this.

If NO:

- You will lie on a scan table that slides into a circular opening of the scanning machine. Pillows and a headrest will be used to prevent movement during the procedure. There will be a strucuture over your head a few inches from your face which will hold the mirror so you can see the screen.
- we will then insert some MRI-safe earbuds into your ears and put some inflatable padding by your head so that both your earbuds stay in place, your head stays in place, and so that the sound from the scanner is muffled
- The technologist will be in another room where the scanner controls are located. However, you will be in constant sight of the technologist through a window. Speakers inside the scanner will enable the technologist to communicate with and hear you. You will have a communication ball so that you can let the technologist know if you have any problems during the procedure. The technologist will be watching you at all times and will be in constant communication.
- During the scanning process, a clicking noise and other sounds will sound. The scanner will also lightly vibrate at some points. The scanner is quite loud and we do everything we can to muffle sounds.
    - Here’s an example of the sounds you’ll hear: [MRI Audio Sounds](https://rutgers.box.com/s/hm6yyhqclbyngto8zhvno5hk9ibmusgo)
- It will be important for you to remain very still during the examination, as any movement could cause distortion and affect the quality of the scan.
- Once the scan is complete, the table will slide out of the scanner and you will be helped off the table.

Any questions?

Ok, great. Let’s head to the scanning center!

## **SECTION 5: Going into the Zone 2 of the MRI center**

First, I'm going to have you go into this room here, and there are scrub tops where you can change into them. Please take off all clothes on the top half of your body.

There are  lockers in here, and that's where you can put all your clothes, your phone, your keys (anything in your pockets). You can keep your pants, socks, and shoes on for now. But we want everything out of your pockets and we want glasses off, jewelry off. Put everything in the locker 

Then you can lock it and take the key.

There's also a restroom right here if you'd like to use the restroom. The scan is an hour and a half, so please use the restroom before.

Once you're ready, I'll be in this room over here, so just walk down! 

### **Researcher setting up Control Room**

[While participant changes, go into scanner control room and set everything up]

Glasses:

- if the participant needs glasses, ask Bernadette to grab the right prescription for them

add glasses procedure notes

Button box:

- On silver control box mounted in the computer rack, press button and go through mode options to set the configuration:
    - click dial -> change mode? Yes, Autoconfig, USB, HID Key **12345**
    - if it’s stuck on something and wont change, go to the back and pull out the power cord, wait a second, and plug back in
- Make sure console reads the following:
    - USB 001 [NOT FLASHING]
    - HHSC-1x4 - L
    - HID KEY 12345”
- ‘USB’ will be flashing on the screen if it’s not registering (will flash if computer is turned off or goes to sleep)

Test button box:

- Ensure button box/keyboard 1 is paired with computer on AV system
- Open Notepad on computer
- Pair computer with monitor inside scan room (so that you can see the computer screen inside the scan room)
- Go in magnet room (REMOVE ALL METAL) and press blue, yellow, blue, yellow, blue, yellow on the button box
- In Notepad, you should see 121212
- Once this is tested and working, close Notepad

### **Once the participant arrives to control room:**

Hi! Okay, great, you have your key, we're going to put it in this small transparent box right here next to the door.

[If they need glasses, hand them to them.]

Now, a final check, you have nothing in your pockets, right? [Watch them pat down their pockets.]

Ok! We can head into the scan room.

## **SECTION 6: Situating the participant in the scanner**

First we’ll have you leave your shoes here right next to the door. 

We’re also going to dim the lights so there are no reflections on the screen. [Dim lights]

Is this light level OK for you? 

[Have them sit on the scanning table]

As a reminder, we’re using the scanner to take pictures of your brain, it is super important that you remain as still as possible while the scans are in progress; if you move too much, the images will be blurry and unusable. And of course, regular breathing and swallowing is totally fine.

For further hearing protection, and so we can communicate with you in between scans, we have this set of headphones for you to wear. You’ll be able to hear us and any audio related to the experiment through these headphones, and there’s also a microphone that you can use to talk to us in between scans. However, because the scanner is very loud while it’s running, we won’t be able to hear you during a scan.

**If PNS:** Just wanted to let you know that you may feel some tingling or twitching during the scan- this is totally normal and not harmful, but if you start to experience any discomfort, you can press this button to stop the scan and trigger an alert so we can talk to you.

If you’re in the middle of scan and need to communicate with us urgently (for example, if you begin to feel sick), you can squeeze this bulb to stop the scan and trigger an alert so we can talk to you. We just ask that you only hit that button in case of an emergency- if you need to go to the bathroom or would like us to reposition your headphones, you can always ask us once the current scan has finished. Remember, each scan is only 1-8 minutes. Here’s the button box that you’ll be using to respond to the experiment.

If you don’t mind, I’m going to place my hand behind your head and guide you down so that you’re perfectly centered in this headrest. Hold your headphones against your ears like this (mime motion), and here we go (guide head down). Great! How does that feel? If it’s at all uncomfortable, definitely let me know- you’re going to be in here for around an hour and we want you to be as comfortable as possible.

We’re also going to grab a sheet and blanket since it’s quite cold in here.

[Grab sheet and blanket from tall cabinets. Put sheet and blanket up to their waist so it doesn’t get too hot.]  We put the blanket and sheet only up to your waist because the MRI machine will heat up slightly on your chest and head, so that part we don't want to get too warm 

How are you feeling? I can also grab you some padding for your arms and legs if that would make you more comfortable. Okay- last thing to do before sending you in is to put on the top piece of this mask, which will help you stay still while in the scanner and see the screen that will be displaying the actual experiment. I’m going to put it on now, you should hear a click when it locks in place. Can you see the screen clearly, and is it roughly centered in your field of view?

1. a) Tell the participant to close their eyes then move them back slightly and turn on the laser. **Don’t tell them to open their eyes until laser is off.
2. b) Make sure the head is straight in the coil. (walk around the back to see their eyes in the mirror) Make sure the subject can see most of the screen. Make sure the participant’s eyes are not covered.
3. c) **64 head coil always

## **SECTION 7: Sound Check**

[Run: sound_check.py]

Hi ________, can you hear me alright? If you’d like me to raise or lower the volume on your headphones, just let me know.

[open Notepad]

First we’re going to check the sound and the button box. Can you try pressing your left finger?  [should see 1 on the notepad]

And now your right finger? [should see 2 on the notepad]

Ok great! That’s working. We’re now going to do a sound check. I’m going to play some audio and we can adjust the volume as needed. [play 3 seconds of audio]

How was that? Could you hear it?

Would you prefer it louder/quieter?

[keep testing until you find a good level]

## **SECTION 8: The first scans**

<aside>
⚠️

NOTE: When talking through the intercom - its a PA system outside of the scanner, not through the earbuds. So make sure you face the speaker when you talk, talk slowly and clearly, and ask the participant if they heard you correctly

</aside>

- Scan times
    
    

Ok, if you’re feeling comfortable, then we’ll get started with the first scan, which should only take about 15 seconds (AAHead_Scout). Remember, when the scanner is running, I won’t be able to hear you, so in the case of an emergency, you’ll have to push the button on your headphones to communicate with me. And one last reminder to stay as still as possible while the scan is in progress. Here we go!

Hi _____ are you still ok? The next scan will be around 5 minutes. Is that ok? Here we go! (anat-T1w_acq-MPRAGE)

Hi _____, how was that? The next scan will be around 3 minutes. Is that ok? Here we go! (anat-mpm_acq-setter, anat-T2w_acq-mgh-navSPACE)

This next run is about 7 minutes long. Just remain still and relaxed please. (

Bold run 1: func-epi_task-rest_BOLD_NORDIC_run-01)

This next run is also about 8 minutes. Please stay still you are doing great. (

FMAPS: fmap-epi_dir-AP_BOLD_NORDIC_run-01, fmap-epi_dir-PA_BOLD_NORDIC_run-01

Bold run 2: func-epi_task-rest_BOLD_NORDIC_run-02,

How are you doing? Were you able to stay awake?

The next bit is a final 2 minutes. Is that ok? (Fieldmap: fmap-fieldmap_acq-B0)

**SECTION 8: Running the Flanker Task**

[Select on psychopy: 250210_flanker_task_TCP.py]

[Press “Run” and enter info into dialogue box]

[PRESS ON THE SECOND MONITOR SCREEN so that the computer is on the screen of the task, not any other window]

Hi _______, how are you doing?

Great, we have the first structural/task/rest scan coming up for you. It should take about 7 minutes (func-epi_task-flanker_BOLD_NORDIC_run-0). To remind you of the instructions, you will first see a blank screen for several seconds. Please do your absolute best to keep as still as possible at the beginning of the run. Then, you will see a white cross appear by itself in the middle of the screen. Please keep your eyes on the cross throughout the entire task.

Before you get started, let’s practice pressing the buttons and doing the task with a few arrows. To practice pressing the buttons, I am going to instruct you to press a key and you will go ahead and press that key. We will do this a few times. Are you ready to start?

Press your pointer finger for left.

Press your middle finger for right.

Pointer finger for left.

Middle finger for right.

Middle finger for right.

Now press the key for left.

Press the key for right.

*[If the subject makes many errors, check finger positioning and repeat the practice as needed.]*

Great job! We are now ready to start the task. It will be just like the practice, but longer at about 7 minutes. I want to remind you that it is imperative to keep your head and body completely still throughout the entire task, from the very first image to the very last image. Do you understand?

Great. Are you ready to start?

Great. Remember to keep as still as possible from head to toe for the next five minutes. Here comes the task.

We are now ready to start the task. It will be just like the practice, but longer at about 6 minutes. Are you ready to start?

Great. Remember to keep as still as possible from head to toe for the next seven minutes, and to respond as quickly and accurately as you can. Here comes the task.

[Run the Flanker task, block 1.]

How are you doing in there?

Great. Please give us a moment to set up for the next run. [Check for movement and give feedback if necessary.]

## **SECTION 9: Running the Language Task**

[Open psychopy builder, open listening_language_task_250214.psyexp]

Hi _______, how are you doing?

We’re now going to have another task. This is the task where you listen to audio and press the button when it’s over, do you remember?

Ok, great. So first it will start with a fixation cross. then the image will come on briefly, like this

Then the audio will play, around 4 seconds.

As soon as the audio is done, press your pointer finger. That will make the cross turn into a star.

Then, the star will turn into a square on it’s own. As soon as you see that, press your pointer finger again.

It will be about 7 minutes (func-epi_task-language_BOLD_NORDIC_run-01).

## **SECTION 10: Running the movie task: The Elevator**

Alright, that’s finished. How do you feel? Next we’ve got a short film. There are no button presses here, just watch the movie. It’s about 3 minutes long. Please do your absolute best to keep as still as possible during the movie. at the beginning of the run.

Sound good? (func-epi_task-theElevator_BOLD_NORDIC_run-01)

## **SECTION 11: Running Diffusion**

Great, we have another scan coming up for you. This one is a bit different as the scanner will vibrate a bit. This will not affect the image, but still try to stay as still as possible. about 8 minutes. To remind you of the instructions, you will first see a blank screen for several seconds. Please do your absolute best to keep as still as possible at the beginning of the run. Then, you will see a plus sign appear by itself in the middle of the screen. Please keep your eyes on the plus sign throughout the entire task

Ok? (dwi-dwi_acq-CMRR-118-dir)

How was that? Now we have a few short scans which won’t vibrate, for about 1 minute. 

(fmap-phasediff_acq-dir-AP, fmap-phasediff_acq-dir-PA)

## **SECTION 12: Movie task: Momentous**

Now we have another short film, this one is around 7 minutes long. Again, we’ll be taking images of your brain so remember not to move. Sound good?

(func-epi_task-momentous_BOLD_NORDIC_run-01)

## **SECTION 13: Final rest runs**

Now we have the final 2 runs of the session, around 14 more minutes. Both are rest runs. How are you feeling?

Ok, starting the  run, 7 minutes: (func-epi_task-rest_BOLD_NORDIC_run-03)

Ok, here is the final 7 minutes. Sound good?  (func-epi_task-rest_BOLD_NORDIC_run-04,

fmap-epi_dir-AP_BOLD_NORDIC_run-02)

Alright, you’re finished! Feel free to move now. I’m coming into the room now to help you out.

## **SECTION 14: In control room after the scan session**

## **SECTION 15: Post-scan battery i**n testing room

This is a self-report survey, similar to the one you did after the clinical interview in the first session. It will take about 1 hour. I’ll be outside the testing room here while you do it, let em know if you hav any questions. I’ll enter the first page for you of your subject ID, and then I’ll leave you to finish the survey

[Open MRI Session [Self-report battery survey](https://rutgers.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0UqGfGjgsl2nklU) on Qualtrics, fill in participant ID]

[Once they’re finished] Great! Did you submit/can I see the last page to see that you submitted it? Thanks so much.

## **SECTION 16: Payment Setup**

Ok, final questions! First, we have digital cards we can send to your email, which will come with a card number so you can use the card like any other card for online purchases. Is this OK?

Great! And is this the best email for you to receive these cards? 

[Check their email on the PCRID Identifiers Linking sheet, change if there’s a better one]

[Open this payment tracking sheet with the gift card links]

[Copy the link + password to a $60 card, and put in the PCRID and current time in recipient fields]

## **SECTION 17: MindLAMP Setup (if applicable)**

Now we’re going to go over the MindLAMP setup. Would you like me to go over the protocol again or do you feel good about it from reading the consent form?

**(Refresher on protocol if they need it, based on how much you already talked about it):**

**Passive Data Collection**

First, passive data is collected automatically in the background while you go about your day. This includes things like how much you move (using your phone’s motion sensors), general location data (GPS), and phone usage patterns like when your screen is on or off. It also includes anonymized information about nearby Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connections, as well as call and text activity logs, which only track things like number of texts sent and length of message, but we **never** record the content of your calls or messages, and we don’t track who you’re talking to. The purpose is just to get a general idea of your social activity levels, never the specifics.

**Active Data Collection**

Next, there’s active data collection. This is where you’ll get 1-2 short surveys per day sent to your phone. These will ask things like how you’re feeling, what you’ve been up to, or how you slept. They’re super quick—usually around two minutes, never more than five. 

**What About Data & Privacy?**

We take your privacy very seriously. Your data is encrypted, stored securely, and never linked to your name—only to a coded identifier. We also make sure all transfers are encrypted, and your information is only accessible to trained researchers. If you ever decide to stop participating, you can uninstall the app and let us know, and we’ll delete your data from our systems (though it may take a couple of months to fully remove all backups). Also, the app only uploads data when you’re connected to Wi-Fi, so it won’t use up your phone’s data plan."

**Compensation**

Here’s how you’ll be compensated for your time. Each month, you’ll be paid based on the number of surveys you complete:

- Complete 5-9 survey days = You’ll earn $5.
- Complete 10-14 =  $10.
- Complete 15-19 = $15.
- Complete 20-24 =  $30.
- Complete 25 or more? = $35

Payment schedule is the end of each month. So for example on the 30th of this month I'll see how many surveys you did this month (even if you in the middle of this month) and pay you based on that.

You can participate for up to six months, starting after your scan. The more surveys you complete, the higher your compensation—it’s that simple! Note that surveys are daily—if you complete 20 surveys in 1 day trying to get $30, it won’t count. You must complete the surveys on separate days.

That’s the gist of it. Do you have any questions?

**MindLAMP notes:**

We currently have daily survey’s set up to alert you at 6pm for the survey. Does that work? We could have it ding you anytime between 5pm-10pm, is there a time that would be best? 

- [If they note a time, put it in their participant file and change it on MindLAMP]

Ready to set up. First i’ll grab your password and ID, which I’ll put in an email to you:

[Pull up Holmes [linking ID sheet](https://rutgers.box.com/s/17t1ffvb5lj80zmsozapvaiurq3qbtd1) to access their MindLamp ID and password]

[Now SENDING this template: [Post-MRI Scan Email Template](https://rutgers.box.com/s/5y7wsd6m2ch9stcpwoq2yupgwuy02jzh): 

filling in these fields:

- Their MindLAMP / qualtrics ID (qual_XXX)
- Their MindLAMP password
- The link to the $60 gift card
- The password/activation to the $60 gift card]

Ok, i’m sending you this email which contains the ID and password you’ll use to sign into the smartphone app, as well as your link for your $60 gift card. Any additional reimbursements from parking/travel or overtime payment will be sent in a follow up email in the next 2 weeks. 

The email also contains:

- The instructions I’m going to go over now, for the smartphone app, in case you forget
- The link to a supplemental survey, which I’ll explain after this
- Blank version of the consent form
- Blank [PCR consent form](https://rutgers.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1GQDBN2Y4DHxSse)
- [Mental_health_resources_NJ](https://rutgers.box.com/s/wdzm85lp57errgwe3msyy8jelainem8s)

Now we’ll set up MindLAMP— this powerpoint will also be emailed to you! 

[Then go through this setup powerpoint to take the participant through download and setup: [MindLAMP Instructions for User](https://rutgers.box.com/s/57h007shwx09wapkhvrg5dcdaumzeltq)]

## **SECTION 18: Supplemental survey**

The last thing is, we've got a final supplemental survey for you. We’ll email it to you, so you can fill it out at home, but you could also fill it out right now if you’d prefer. You’ll get $30 more for completing it! This is similar to what you filled out for an hour here on Qualtrics on the testing computer. It is an hour of self-report surveys and there's also some little cognitive tests that you'll be linked to that will involve things like choosing shapes or testing your reaction time. The link to the survey is in the email I sent, that also has the information for the gift card and all of your follow-up information. We’re aiming to have everyone fill it out within 48 hours. Does that feel possible for you? [If no, make notes in the sheet]

Would you like to fill it out now, here, or do it at home? 

[If here, take them back to the testing room and set them up on the computer.

## **SECTION 18: Goodbye**

- Say, “I’ll be walking out with you to show you the way. Please make sure you have all your belongings”
- GIVE a copy of (physical paper)
    - Blank [PCR consent form](https://rutgers.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1GQDBN2Y4DHxSse)
    - [Mental_health_resources_NJ](https://rutgers.box.com/s/wdzm85lp57errgwe3msyy8jelainem8s)

The debriefing should be short and say something like (Whether this is over email or verbally): “We are using neuroimaging methods to identify biological pathways and functional differences associated with psychiatric illnesses. We really appreciate you taking the time to participate in our study, and we hope to see you again soon!”

*If they do not complete the supplemental on a lab computer, make sure to email them the link to it within 24 hours.*

## SECTION 19: Once Participant Leaves

1. EMAIL the task files to yourself from the scanning computer
2. Add up the additional payments for the subject, including gas costs, parking/tolls costs, uber/lyft costs and overtime costs, and do the calculations in the subject log sheet for how much the subject is owed. Then put in an order to PerfectGift for that amount, rounding to the nearest dollar.
