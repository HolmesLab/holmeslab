# Script for Clinical Interview Session

Date: April 16, 2025 8:09 AM

Hi! Thank you for coming in today. I’m going to be reading from a script to make sure each participant has a similar experience.

The first thing we’re going to do is go over the consent forms. This study is being led by Dr Avram Holmes, who is a faculty member in the department of Psychiatry. Their study consists of this session today and a second session with an MRI scan. The first consent form is a consent for the activities we’ll ask you to do today, which include a structured clinical interview, which will take 20min-2hours. This is exactly like the interview you did with us when you first came into CCNP, we’re just doing it again to make sure the diagnosis is up to date. After that, I may ask you some more questions about your symptoms specifically in the last two weeks. The third thing we’d do today is an online survey. I would send you the link and you would fill it out yourself. This is expected to take around 1 hour. Signing this consent form confirms that you are willing to do these activities and willing to have your information shared with the study staff at Dr Avram Holmes’ lab, so they can schedule with you the MRI scanning session. I’ll let you read through the consent form now, let me know if you have any questions.

The second consent form is for the MRI scanning session. If you sign this form today, you’ll also be asked to sign the same form when you go in for the MRI scan. You can always decide not to participate, even if you sign it today. This consent form goes over the activities you would do in this session and the second session. These include some more surveys, a 90 minute MRI scan and some optional components. The optional components are a third set of online surveys and a smartphone-app tracking study. I’ll let you read through the consent form now, let me know if you have any questions.
