**CAHBIR News** \- News and announcements from the Center for Advanced Human Brain Imaging Research will be posted here. Please visit [Mailman - Email distribution (rutgers.edu)](https://it.rutgers.edu/email-distribution/mailman/) to be added to the mailing list.

**IRB Boilerplate Language -** CAHBIR has prepared documents providing language already reviewed and approved by the Rutgers IRB responsible for overseeing human subjects research at CAHBIR. Since the language has already been approved by the IRB and is consistent with CAHBIR policies, users are strongly recommended to use these as starting points in the preparation of their own IRB protocols. For access to these documents please visit [New User Introduction to CAHBIR Resources - CAHBIR Wiki (rutgers.edu). Please pay particular attention to issues in the protocol and consent documents related to](https://cahbir.rutgers.edu/wiki/index.php/New_User_Introduction_to_CAHBIR_Resources#IRB_Boilerplate_Language) MRI safety, pregnancy, and incidental findings.

**Protocol Setup** - Every study involves a set of compromises in parameters- timing etc**.,** and studies sometimes require establishing new parameters. You should consult with Dr. Jeffrey Luci [jeffrey.luci@rutgers.edu](mailto:jeffrey.luci@rutgers.edu) prior to your first study to have your first protocol built, or if adding significant new elements to an existing protocol.

**CAHBIR MRI Level 1 Safety Training -** All users who routinely attend MRI Scans at CAHBIR must attend a Level 1 training session before they begin participating in any research scans. If you or any of your lab members intend to be present during scans or will require access to CAHBIR, please sign up for and attend one of these sessions. <https://signup.com/go/vyYebZJ>

**CAHBIR Qualtrics Screening Form Access** - CAHBIR uses Qualtrics to provide online screening forms for research subjects and visitors. To register your account, follow the instructions below.

**Registering a Qualtrics Account -** Qualtrics is available to all Rutgers personnel. However, if you have never used Qualtrics, you do not have a Qualtrics account. Creating one is as simple as logging in with your NetID credentials at the Rutgers Qualtrics page [Qualtrics - Rutgers IT](https://it.rutgers.edu/qualtrics/). As soon as you have logged in, you may log out. It is not necessary to make any changes. Once you have done that, or if you already have an active Qualtrics account associated with Rutgers, e-mail [CAHBIR-support@rutgers.edu](mailto:CAHBIR-support@rutgers.edu) with your full name, NetID, name of your PI, and project you will be working on. CAHBIR staff will grant you permission to use the relevant tools.

**CAHBIR Scheduling** -

- Labs will reserve sessions for the **3T Prisma Scanner, Mock Scanner and EEG rooms using iLab** -<https://rutgers.ilab.agilent.com>. Please note that scanner reservations **must** include all time necessary to set up experiments and clean up afterwards. An additional **15 minutes** on top of the total scan time is suggested.
- If the PI does not have an iLab account, they must first create one. If assistance is needed to set up your account, please contact our Agilent representatives, Gabriela Alulema, [galulema@research.rutgers.edu](mailto:galulema@research.rutgers.edu) and/or Cristina Estillore, [cristina.estillore@rutgers.edu](mailto:cristina.estillore@rutgers.edu).
- Each member of the lab that will require access to iLab to make reservations must first create an account in iLab and then request access from the PI. Please follow the instructions below:

To get setup in iLab you will first need to register and request access from your PI. Once you are an approved member of your PIs lab, project numbers will **also** need to be assigned to you before you can place requests.

**Registration for Lab Members:**

- Go to the following link:
    [https://rutgers.ilab.agilent.com/landing/196](https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Frutgers.ilab.agilent.com%2Flanding%2F196&data=05%7C01%7Cbl711%40rbhs.rutgers.edu%7C68ddfaf207d449e78bd308db8e07f566%7Cb92d2b234d35447093ff69aca6632ffe%7C1%7C0%7C638259937046584783%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=%2BHOYVuiO3RNEyWWilKyn3bOR4DuWUhuYKoykQUX5Yng%3D&reserved=0)
- In the upper-right-hand corner of the screen click 'Sign-Up'. When the pop-up appears, click "here" under Rutgers University user.
- You will be directed to an authentication page where you will need to enter your Rutgers credentials and click _Login_.
- Next, you will be directed to an iLab Registration page where you will need to select a PI/Lab and verify your contact information. Select **PILastName, PIFirstName (Rutgers) Lab.**
- Once you complete and submit the registration, your request will need to be approved by your PI.
- Please notify us at  [CAHBIR-support@rutgers.edu](mailto:CAHBIR-support@rutgers.edu) once your PI has approved your request, we will then add you to CAHBIR's list of confirmed customers in iLab which will allow you to make reservations.

- Labs will reserve **Testing/Meeting Rooms** using [Meeting Room Booking System (rutgers.edu)](https://cahbir.rutgers.edu/scheduling/) - These rooms can be used for consenting, pre/post testing, practicing tasks, etc. and are available to labs at no charge

**\*\*\*Please note** - access to the Meeting Room Booking System page is only allowed to systems on the Rutgers network. You must be plugged into the Rutgers network, connected to Rutgers Secure Wi-Fi, or signed in to [the VPN client](https://it.rutgers.edu/guides/remote-access-with-anyconnect-virtual-private-network/) - [Remote Access with AnyConnect (virtual private network) - Information Technology (rutgers.edu)](https://it.rutgers.edu/guides/remote-access-with-anyconnect-virtual-private-network/)

- Go to [Meeting Room Booking System (rutgers.edu)](https://cahbir.rutgers.edu/scheduling/), and log in with your group's credentials. The username is the PIs last name, all lowercase. The password (which should be changed as soon as possible) is the PIs last name, all lowercase, followed by 1234. (Ex. zald1234)

**\*\*\*If you are having trouble logging in, please contact** [CAHBIR-support@rutgers.edu](mailto:CAHBIR-support@rutgers.edu) **this may indicate that your group has not yet been created by admin.**

- From the pulldown menu, select testing or huddle rooms as appropriate.
- Navigate to the day you need and select the starting time for the room you want in the grid.
- In the menu that appears, fill out A) Your name; B) Any description you would like to show on the calendar (optional); C) The start and end times; D) the area (which should already be correctly populated); E) the room you want (again, should be populated); and finally, F) click save.

**CAHBIR Flywheel** - Archiving, processing, and curation of imaging data collected at CAHBIR are handled by the third-party biomedical research data management platform, <https://cahbir-flywheel.rutgers.edu/>. Unless specifically requested, all imaging data collected at CAHBIR will be automatically uploaded to Flywheel. Flywheel has been vetted by Rutgers IT Risk Management. Because archiving is managed by Google Cloud Services, this should be noted in your IRB protocols. Both Google Cloud Services and Flywheel are HIPAA compliant. Flywheel additionally provides the ability to run "gears" and perform automated processing on data. Note, that if you are running substantial "gears" there will be charges for CPU time on Google Cloud Services that your lab will be responsible for. However, there is no charge for access or downloading of data.

**CAHBIR Directions & Lot 58C Parking Permits** - Please visit [Parking Permits - CAHBIR Wiki (rutgers.edu)](https://cahbir.rutgers.edu/wiki/index.php/Parking_Permits) for information regarding directions and parking permits.

**CAHBIR Cancellation Policy** - Reserved scan time during normal CAHBIR operational hours that is not cancelled at least 24 hours before it starts will be billed even if the time is unused. Please view our policy below for further information [Scheduling, Overruns, and Cancellations - CAHBIR Wiki (rutgers.edu).](https://cahbir.rutgers.edu/wiki/index.php/Scheduling,_Overruns,_and_Cancellations)

We understand that circumstances surrounding cancellations are frustrating and usually beyond the control of the lab, so we have compiled a list of suggestions for you to consider.

- If you have not had communication with the subject to confirm the day prior, we suggest cancelling the session ahead of time to avoid the cancellation fee. (Ex - If you have a 3pm appointment tomorrow and have not heard from them by 2pm today I would proactively cancel tomorrow's appointment. If they confirm later in the day the lab can always put them back on the schedule if a timeslot is still available.
- Does your project include "healthy controls"? If yes, we suggest having a pool of participants who would be willing to fill in at the last minute as a replacement if your subject does not show up for the scan.
- Also, if your subject confirms but does not show up for the session, the lab is permitted to find a replacement that could come in during any of the available timeslots on that same day. (Ex - your session is at 10am, your subject does not show, you find a replacement that can come in for a 3pm session that day - we will waive the cancellation fee.

**Incidental Findings -** At your earliest convenience we ask that you please familiarize yourself with CAHBIR's policy on [Incidental Findings - CAHBIR Wiki (rutgers.edu).](https://cahbir.rutgers.edu/wiki/index.php/Incidental_Findings)

Radiology reports will be uploaded to REDCap, each PI will have access to these reports within a project created by CAHBIR staff. Reports should be reviewed by the PI and/or a lab member approved by the PI to access the project. If clinical follow-up has been suggested by the Radiologist, the lab must document in REDCap that the subject was notified of the finding. Please contact [CAHBIR-support@rutgers.edu](mailto:CAHBIR-support@rutgers.edu) if you have any questions regarding this process.
