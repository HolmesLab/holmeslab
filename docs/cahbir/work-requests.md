# Work Requests at CAHBIR

Date: April 2, 2025 4:00 PM

Only do this if you NEED to, they generally are slow, unresponsive, not good and super expensive. 

Below is the link to use to submit a work order. Click on "Maintenance Request" and complete the necessary boxes. You will explain what work you need done in the comments box.

Just a heads up I don't usually get a response for when they will arrive so you may want to leave specific instructions on where you want them to be hung or even come borrow some painters tape to label the wall and position in case you are not available when they arrive. Let me know I we can help any further.

You should then get an email with an invoice, with an invoice attached with an estimate for chargeable work, like this:
