This is a primer on transportation to the Holmes Lab on Rutgers New Brunswick Campus. This is for lab members or collaborators who are planning on coming in person to Rutgers and visitors to the lab. 

### HOLMES LAB LOCATION
To find the lab location, look up [“Center for Advanced Human Brain Imaging Research”](https://go.rutgers.edu/map-to-CAHBIR) on Google Maps, or use [this link](https://go.rutgers.edu/map-to-CAHBIR) on google maps. (Typing in the address, 661 Hoes Ln W, will NOT direct you to the front of the building). 
You can also look up this parking lot (the nearest on-campus one) Lot 58B, address: 135 Bevier Rd, Piscataway, NJ 08854

**Parking Lot**
Nearest Rutgers parking lot is Lot 58B, address: 135 Bevier Rd, Piscataway, NJ 08854

This parking lot is permit-only, but the Rutgers parking permit system is such that you only get tickets if your license plate number is registered in the Rutgers system. So, if you park in this lot and you aren’t already in the Rutgers system, you won’t be required to pay any tickets issued to your license plate, because it’s not linked to you. However, if you later register in the Rutgers parking system, you’ll have to pay any tickets which had been assigned to your license plate number (if you had parked + gotten tickets in Rutgers before signing up). However, this is how we tell participants to park, since as long as you’re not in the Rutgers system, it’s OK. Also, the ticketing is not super frequent. Someone at CAHBIR parked in the lot 3x/week for 6mos and only had 3 tickets in the system once they signed up. But that could always change!  

Visitors can be issued a one-day virtual permit through using the departments parking account. Contact the lab manager to for a one-day visitor permit. If more than one visitor needs a one-day pass in a day, visitors may purchase a one-day virtual permit using the Passport parking app. Visit https://www.passportparking.com/, or download the app from Apple/Google Play Store.
