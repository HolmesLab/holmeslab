    10. Assuming all goes well, DOTS will reach out in **1-2 days** with a Nupark Account # which you will need to store in a safe space that you will remember!
        1. You will use the Nupark Account # when requesting new permits.
        2. Nupark Account # is simply where the parking permits end up and do not indicate the funding mechanism of the permits!

1. **"How did you know that CANL had to register as a new department for parking passes?"**
    1. CANL (the name of Dr. Zald's lab outside of CAHBIR proper) had not, as of then, needed to issue parking permits, so a departmental account was never created. Thus, we had to make one to issue parking passes that were being used for CANL-specific purposes.
        1. Suppose you are using the CAHBIR parking permits. In that case, those permits **must** go to participants **actively participating in a CAHBIR-specific project** (i.e., using the scanner and potentially the ECG in the future, but don't quote me on that).
        2. So, if you expect your lab to have participants participating in your lab-specific projects and not CAHBIR-specific, then you would need to set up a departmental account since all parking permits are pooled and are not delineated by who purchased them per se.
            1. For example, if you are in the CAHBIR departmental account, and you submit a purchase order for new parking permits for that departmental account using your lab's start-up fund or grant money, ANYONE who has access to the CAHBIR departmental account could use it.
    2. Since your lab is brand new, you still need to set up a departmental account.
2. **"Do you know if the 1-visitor-day-pass for $1 is just for CAHBIR (like there can only be one visitor-day-pass from all of CAHBIR before you have to start paying full price), or is it for each lab/each requestor?"**
    1. I am unfamiliar with the $1 pass for CAHBIR, so I cannot speak to that.
    2. From my experience, all 1-day parking permits are $5 and have always been $5.
        1. Feel free to contact **Jeff Lucci,** as he was initially the parking czar for CAHBIR (although it is way below his pay grade) if you have additional questions about the $1 parking permit.
3. **"Could theoretically someone from my lab use it when commuting twice a week?"**
    1. Unfortunately, parking passes **CAN'T** be used by Rutgers Staff **OR** Students, so lab members would not be allowed to use them even if they only come once or twice a week. The same goes for study participants if they are students!
        1. DOTS says that any violations of this could result in suspending the departmental account and shutting down the parking accounts for whoever was involved.
        2. It's a ridiculous rule, and I don't know how they would know if your lab members never registered with DOTS, but I wouldn't risk it.
            1. There are visitor parking lots nearby that people can use (roughly a 5-minute walk).
                1. e.g., Lot B near the Rutgers Day School
                    1. Address of Rutgers Day School (671 Hoes Ln W, Piscataway, NJ 08854)
    2. The student aspect is the most annoying, but DOTS is adamant about keeping it the same as there was rampant misuse of the system in the past, so we're at an impasse.
