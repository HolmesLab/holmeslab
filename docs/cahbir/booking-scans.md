- Editing Reservation Requests
    - Labs are now able to cancel a reservation in iLab after it has been approved. Please note that iLab will warn you of a fee even when the reservation is canceled outside of the 24-hour cancelation period. CAHBIR staff will refer to the timestamp provided at the time of cancelation to determine if a fee is warranted. Unfortunately, editing approved reservations is still NOT permitted. Alternatively, you may cancel the original reservation and reserve the correct date/time. Labs are no longer required to submit a request to [cahbir-support@rutgers.edu](mailto:cahbir-support@rutgers.edu) when canceling or editing approved reservations. Please reach out with any questions.
