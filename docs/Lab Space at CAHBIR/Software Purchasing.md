### Purchasing Software / License that RUWare doesn‚Äôt work with

Two options: 

1. Pay and submit for reimbursement 
2. Submit a service request
    1. Service request, not quick order, because in ‚Äú
    

### Submitting a Service Request

1. See if the supplier has a contract
2. Look up supplier contract in [https://procurementservices.rutgers.edu/purchasing/](https://procurementservices.rutgers.edu/purchasing/dropbox-inc)
    1. Under ‚ÄòProcurement Procedures‚Äô, it will list the necessary steps / forms
        1. Ex: Dropbox at [https://procurementservices.rutgers.edu/purchasing/dropbox-inc](https://procurementservices.rutgers.edu/purchasing/dropbox-inc) requires:
            - [Service Request Form](https://solutions.sciquest.com/apps/Router/SAMLAuth/Rutgers)
                - with detailed quote
            - [Third Party Risk Assessment](https://rusecure.rutgers.edu/third-party-security-review-process) form submission
3. If the supplier does not have a contract:
    1. Find a contact for the supplier
    2. Notify them that an invitation will be coming their way / ask them if they will accept it
    3. Follow this Job Aid: [Supplier Onboarding Course Pathway in Canvas](https://rutgers.instructure.com/courses/31949/pages/job-aid-inviting-a-new-supplier-and-checking-onboarding-status?module_item_id=6484653) 
        1. After you [submit your invitation on PaymentWorks](https://www.paymentworks.com/app), you‚Äôll be able to see the progress on there, as well as get emails
    4. This is the email you‚Äôll get when your invitation has been approved and sent to your supplier
        
        ![Screen Shot 2024-04-01 at 4.51.32 PM.png](Software Purchasing - Sharable fc68c5ec5a5141989de8c3d0222903d2/Screen_Shot_2024-04-01_at_4.51.32_PM.png)
        
    5. This is the email they‚Äôll get from PaymentWorks
        
        ![Screen Shot 2024-04-01 at 4.42.09 PM.png](Software Purchasing - Sharable fc68c5ec5a5141989de8c3d0222903d2/Screen_Shot_2024-04-01_at_4.42.09_PM.png)
        
        f. This is the email you‚Äôll get when they open/ start registration in PaymentWorks
        
        ![Screen Shot 2024-04-01 at 4.43.08 PM.png](Software Purchasing - Sharable fc68c5ec5a5141989de8c3d0222903d2/Screen_Shot_2024-04-01_at_4.43.08_PM.png)
        
        g. Once the supplier finishes their PaymentWorks portal, this is what PaymentWorks will look like
        
        ![Screen Shot 2024-04-01 at 4.55.11 PM.png](Software Purchasing - Sharable fc68c5ec5a5141989de8c3d0222903d2/Screen_Shot_2024-04-01_at_4.55.11_PM.png)
        
        h. Now you will be able to follow the instructions above, for submitting a service request to this supplier, as they are now in the Rutgers system
