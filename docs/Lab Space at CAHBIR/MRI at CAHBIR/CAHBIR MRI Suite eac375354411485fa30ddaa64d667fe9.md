## Training Requirements

- To schedule scans in iLab, no training is required, just the creation of an iLab account, PI approval and CAHBIR admin approval
- MRI Training 1 is required to be the assistant to an MR technician. This means giving the consent form to the participant, doing any data collection or surveys, explaining scanning procedure and accompanying them into the control room. From there the MR technician (Bernadette Lovas, usually) will do another pre-scan overview to double check, will take them into the magnet room and get them set up, and then operate the scanner from the control room. You will be in the control room for assistance and also to carry out any study procedures.
    - 1-2 hour course
    - Ask Jeff or Bernadette when the next one is, happens when there is enough demand
- MRI Training 2 is required to be the MR technician and access the scanning room without Bernadette.
    - Full-day course
    - Happens less frequently, ask Jeff or Bernadette

## Scheduling Scans

(Holmes Lab Project Code is Project 836892-800)

- The scanner can be requested on iLab:
    
    iLab: [https://rutgers.ilab.agilent.com/](https://rutgers.ilab.agilent.com/) 
    
    - log into ilab (registration link here: [https://rutgers.ilab.agilent.com/landing/196](https://rutgers.ilab.agilent.com/landing/196))
    - Request access from your PI
    - They allow
    - Then CAHBIR allows
    - Then you get access to project codes
        - (Holmes Lab Project Code is Project 836892-800)
    - Then you can request in iLab
        - You’ll get an email when the reservation has been approved
        - it will be approved unless it’s overlapping with another lab

- Editing Reservation Requests
    - Labs are now able to cancel a reservation in iLab after it has been approved. Please note that iLab will warn you of a fee even when the reservation is canceled outside of the 24-hour cancelation period. CAHBIR staff will refer to the timestamp provided at the time of cancelation to determine if a fee is warranted. Unfortunately, editing approved reservations is still NOT permitted. Alternatively, you may cancel the original reservation and reserve the correct date/time. Labs are no longer required to submit a request to [cahbir-support@rutgers.edu](mailto:cahbir-support@rutgers.edu) when canceling or editing approved reservations. Please reach out with any questions.
