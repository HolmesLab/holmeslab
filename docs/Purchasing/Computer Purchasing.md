        1. If you don’t know the accounting codes, check Accounting Codes Tutorial - How To Find Accounting Codes

        1. RUWare will fill in those things, along with add any necessary insurance and change ship-to location if necessary

    “Hi RUWare Team,
    
    Our lab would like to purchase a _______ (example: 24-inch iMac (M1, 2021) with the following specs: green, 8-core CPU/8 core GPU, 16 GB memory, 1TB SSD storage). . Please let me know if any additional information is required. Last time, I was sent quote back from RUWare formatted by your template, and adding item numbers which I could then review and then get signed by my PI and Department Head. I’ll wait on your review and formatting before sending to get it signed.
    Also, this will not be related to UBHC and the software engineer in our department (Wil Rolhill) will configure the machine with encryption and set up for use. (Department: Center for Advanced Human Brain Imaging, RWJ Department of Psychiatry Research)
    
    Thank you for your assistance,
    
3. Get returned a quote from RUWare. 
4. Review it, and then
    1. Send to David for signature
    2. Send to Avram for signature
5. Send signed quote back to RUWare, with David and Avram CC’d
6. Once it has been processed, you’ll get a message like this from RUWare:

1. “Good Morning, This email is to confirm that the received quote has been processed in Marketplace and submitted under Requisition 183318839.”
2. That requisition should be visible in your marketplace— you can see where it is being shipped to, and whether it’s been sent to supplier, and status:

3.  A purchase order will also have been made by UBHC. You can view the invoices, items and PO number, and whether it’s been completed

4. Then you should get emails from Kite+Key and the supplier (or sciquest) about your order having been processed

8. Your packages will arrive to wherever they were shipped to, according to the tracking number etc. you received from Kite and Key or the supplier. If they were to #D117 at UBHC, Pedro Fernandes ([fernanpm@ubhc.rutgers.edu](mailto:fernanpm@ubhc.rutgers.edu)) will receive them, and email him to ask if they’ve arrived (he’ll also probably email you if they do arrive)

1. Coordinate a time with him to pickup your items (only a 2 min walk from CAHBIR)
