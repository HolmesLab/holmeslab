# Self-Report Scales
Date: Apr 20, 2025 12:05 PM

We have copies of many scales for self-report batteries. 

Copies of the PDFs of these scales are located in the folder [Self-Report Scales](https://rutgers.box.com/s/5hpvf103c29sdj2htp2hmgg4ks3pnr72) in the Box. 

There are also scripts for [processing self-report scales](https://rutgers.box.com/s/n42fkb63ri5yvorx2phrmqwlt2b60r1g). 

We often implement self-report scales on Qualtrics for ease of administration and data analysis. Rutgers qualtrics can be accessed by logging in with your netID to [https://rutgers.yul1.qualtrics.com/](https://rutgers.yul1.qualtrics.com/).

This is where the current self-report scales for the Psychiatric Connectomes and Conte projects are located. To be added to these contact Kaley or Avram.
