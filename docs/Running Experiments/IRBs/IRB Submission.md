> Tips on Protocol
> 
- Use lay-person language- IRB staff are not experts in your field
- Don’t use undefined acronyms or jargon
- Don’t use Google docs / excel - not approved for research purposes
    - If you’re using Rutgers-sponsored application, like MS Office, Box etc, reference that they’re Rutgers
    - if you’re using not Rutgers-sponsored, you must include the app privacy information

### Tips on filling out IRB Application in [eIRB](https://eirb.rutgers.edu/) (Holmes-Lab)

1. Sign into with your NetID
    1. Make sure your profile lists the correct affiliation
    2. Make sure you’ve completed your necessary CITI courses (Aka Basic course: social-behavioral research OR Basic Course: biomedical study)
2. First page— select “Rutgers Health and Biomedical Sciences” Because we’re under RWJHS
3. If study staff or co-investigators have completed CITI courses but they weren’t submitted via their Rutgers email and they haven’t transferred over, you can attach the CITI certificate of completion in the “Additional Supporting Documents” page 
    1. See steps below for doing CITI courses
4. If you have Co-investigators, select “Notify co-investigators” in ***My Activities***. They need to accept the invitation to be a co-investigator.
5. Each person (co-investigators, study staff, etc) all must complete and submit a eCOI financial disclosure form (see steps below)
6. If you are ready to submit, the PI must submit the study under his/her ***My Activities*** section. (Study coordinator, staff, collaborators etc. cannot do this, only the single specified PI)
7. If you get reviewer notes, you can find them in the “History” section or “Reviewer Notes” section
    1. You must ‘reply’ to each comment by the reviewer, as well as fixing it
